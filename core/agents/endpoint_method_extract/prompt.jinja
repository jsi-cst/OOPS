You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing web projects developed using {{ plang }} and the {{ frame }} framework. I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `{{ file }}`, I found that `{{ handler }}` is implemented to process HTTP requests {%- if path %} to the path `{{ path }}` {%- endif %}. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.

I'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:

- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).
- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.
- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.
- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.
- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.
- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.
- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.
- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.
- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.
- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.

You also need to provide an explanation of your results.
