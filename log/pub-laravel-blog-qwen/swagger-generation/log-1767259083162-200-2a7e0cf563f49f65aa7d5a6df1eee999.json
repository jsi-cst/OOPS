I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/v1/posts/{post}` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostController.php`, `PostController` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostController@destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n3. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostController@show` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n4. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostController.php`, `PostController` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n5.

Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

Let me examine the `destroy` method in the `PostController` class.\n\nFrom the provided code, I can see that:\n\n1. The `destroy` method takes a `Post $post` parameter (which is resolved via route model binding)\n2. It authorizes the delete action using `$this->authorize('delete', $post)`\n3. It deletes the post using `$post->delete()`\n4. It returns `response()->noContent()` which returns an HTTP 204 No Content response\n\nLet me check if there are any other response scenarios by looking at the authorization policies or any exception handling that might occur. I should also check if there are any validation or error scenarios that could result in different response codes.\n\n",
