I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/posts/{post}/likes` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n3. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n4. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

Takes a `Post` model as a parameter (injected via route model binding)\n2. Calls `$post->dislike()` to remove the like\n3. Returns a `MultiplePendingTurboStreamResponse` which creates Turbo Stream responses\n4.

Let me also check if there could be any error responses or validation that might affect the response codes.\n\nBased on my analysis:\n\n1. The DELETE endpoint `/posts/{post}/likes` is handled by the `destroy` method\n2. The method expects a valid `Post` model (route model binding will return 404 if post doesn't exist)\n3. The method calls `$post->dislike()` to remove the like\n4. It returns a Turbo Stream response with updated UI elements\n5. The response content type would be `text/vnd.turbo-stream.html`\n\nFor a successful DELETE request, the response would be a 200 OK with the Turbo Stream content. If the post doesn't exist, it would result in a 404 error due to route model binding.\n\nLet me also consider potential error scenarios. Since the route uses route model binding (`Post $post`), if the post doesn't exist, Laravel will automatically return a 404 response.\n\nThe final generated result begins\n```json\n{\n  \"200\": {\n    \"description\": \"Successfully removed like from post, returns Turbo Stream response to update UI\",\n    \"content\": {\n      \"text/vnd.turbo-stream.html\": {\n        \"schema\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"Turbo Stream response containing HTML fragments to update the like button and likes count\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"404\": {\n    \"description\": \"Post not found\"\n  },\n  \"401\": {\n    \"description\": \"Unauthorized - user not authenticated\"\n  }\n}\n```",
