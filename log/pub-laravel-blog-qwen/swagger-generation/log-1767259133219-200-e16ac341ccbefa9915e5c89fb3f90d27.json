I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with method POST, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostLikeController@store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method POST.\n\n2. In `app/Concern/Likeable.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostLikeController@store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method POST.\n\n3. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostLikeController@destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method POST.\n\n4. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostLikeController@store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method POST.\n\n5.

Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

Let me first understand what the controller and trait are doing.\n\nFrom the provided code:\n1. `PostLikeController@store` method handles POST requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/likes`\n2. The method calls `$post->like()` which is defined in the `Likeable` trait\n3. The `like()` method creates a like if it doesn't exist yet, or returns nothing if it already exists\n\nLet me check the routes file to confirm the endpoint configuration and also look at the Post model to see if it uses the Likeable trait:\n\n",
