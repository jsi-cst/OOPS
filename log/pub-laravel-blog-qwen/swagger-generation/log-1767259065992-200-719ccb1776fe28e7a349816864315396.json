I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/admin/comments/{comment}` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Admin\\\\CommentController` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/admin/comments/{comment}` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Admin\\\\CommentController` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/admin/comments/{comment}` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "Let me analyze the DELETE endpoint for `/admin/comments/{comment}` step by step.\n\nFrom the provided code, I can see that the `destroy` method in `CommentController` handles the deletion of a comment:\n\n1. The method signature is `public function destroy(Comment $comment): RedirectResponse`\n2. It takes a `Comment $comment` parameter (which is resolved via route model binding)\n3. It calls `$comment->delete()` to remove the comment from storage\n4. It returns a `RedirectResponse` that redirects to the comments index route with a success message\n\nSince this is a web-based admin controller (evident from the use of `RedirectResponse` and view rendering in other methods), the DELETE endpoint will return a redirect response rather than a JSON response. The response will redirect to the comments index page with a success message.\n\nLet me check if there are any routes defined for this endpoint to confirm the exact route structure:\n\n",
