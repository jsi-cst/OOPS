I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/v1/posts/{post}/comments` with method POST, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostCommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostCommentController@store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/comments` with HTTP method POST.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostCommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostCommentController@index` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/comments` with HTTP method POST.\n\n3. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostCommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostCommentController@store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/comments` with HTTP method POST.\n\n4. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostCommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostCommentController@index` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/comments` with HTTP method POST.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a list of Parameter Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].parameters) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the list of Parameter Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

From the provided information, I can see that the `store` method in `PostCommentController` handles this endpoint. Let me examine the parameters that would be expected for this endpoint.\n\nLooking at the `store` method:\n- It takes a `CommentsRequest $request` and a `Post $post` parameter\n- The `Post $post` parameter suggests there's a path parameter `{post}` \n- The method uses `$request->input('content')` which indicates there's a content field in the request body\n\nI should also check the route definition to confirm the endpoint structure and see if there are any additional parameters or validation rules defined in the `CommentsRequest` class.\n\nLet me first check the route file to confirm the endpoint structure:\n\n",
