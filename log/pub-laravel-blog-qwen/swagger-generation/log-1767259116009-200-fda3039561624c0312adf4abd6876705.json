I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/posts/{post}/likes` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n3. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n4. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

From the information provided, I can see that the `destroy` method in `PostLikeController` handles the DELETE request for this endpoint. Let me examine the controller code and understand what the response would be.\n\nLooking at the code, the `destroy` method:\n1. Takes a `Post` model as a parameter (injected via route model binding)\n2. Calls `$post->dislike()` to remove the like\n3. Returns a `MultiplePendingTurboStreamResponse` which creates Turbo Stream responses\n4. The response includes:\n   - A replace operation for the like element with a view `likes._like`\n   - An update operation for the likes count element\n\nI need to understand what the TurboLaravel package returns in terms of HTTP response format. Let me check if there are any route definitions that might help clarify which method handles the DELETE request.\n\n",
