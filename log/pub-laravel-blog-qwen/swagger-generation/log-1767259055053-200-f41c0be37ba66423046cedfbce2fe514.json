I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/users/{user}` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\UserController::show` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/users/{user}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\UserController::update` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/users/{user}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n3. In `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`, `App\\Http\\Controllers\\UserController::show` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/users/{user}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n4. In `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\UserController::show` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/users/{user}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n5. In `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\UserController::update` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/users/{user}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n6. In `app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php`, `App\\Http\\Controllers\\UserController::show` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/users/{user}` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

        "content": "I need to analyze the endpoint `/users/{user}` with method GET. From the provided information and code, I can see that the `show` method in `UserController` handles this endpoint. Let me analyze what this method does:\n\n1. The `show` method takes a `Request` and a `User` model as parameters\n2. It returns a `View` by rendering the 'users.show' template\n3. It passes several data points to the view: user info, posts count, comments count, likes count, recent posts, and recent comments\n\nSince this is a GET request to `/users/{user}`, I need to determine what the response would look like. The method returns a View, which means it's likely returning an HTML response rather than a JSON response. However, in API contexts, we might also have JSON responses.\n\nLet me check if there are any route definitions that might clarify whether this is an API route or web route:\n\n",
