I'm now focusing on endpoint `/posts/{post}` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php`, `App\\Http\\Controllers\\PostController::show` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php`, `App\\Http\\Controllers\\PostController::show` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a list of Parameter Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].parameters) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the list of Parameter Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."
