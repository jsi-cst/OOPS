The routing setup (which HTTP methods and paths map to which handler functions) is defined in routes/clients.js. This file imports the actual handler implementations from the controllers.\n- The business logic for handling client-related requests is implemented in controllers/clients.js. It exports the handler functions such as getClients, createClient, updateClient, deleteClient, and getClientsByUser, which are wired by routes/clients.js to the corresponding HTTP endpoints.\n- For context, the handlers rely on the ClientModel defined in models/ClientModel.js, which defines the schema used by the controllers. However, the actual routing logic is in routes/clients.js and the handler implementations are in controllers/clients.js."
