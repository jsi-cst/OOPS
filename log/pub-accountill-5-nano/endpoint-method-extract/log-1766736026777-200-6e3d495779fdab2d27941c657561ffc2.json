Express automatically handles HEAD for routes that have a GET handler, returning the same headers with an empty body, even though HEAD isn’t explicitly defined in code.\n\n- POST: Not acceptable. There is no POST handler for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS: Acceptable. While there’s no explicit OPTIONS handler, the global CORS middleware (cors()) handles OPTIONS preflight requests and responds with appropriate headers.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable. There is no TRACE handler, and TRACE is not configured in the code.\n\n- GET: Acceptable. The route is defined as router.get('/count', getTotalCount) and implemented in controllers/invoices.js.\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable. No PUT handler for this path.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable. No DELETE handler for this path.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable. No PATCH handler for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is mounted under /invoices via app.use('/invoices', invoiceRoutes) in index.js, and the specific route is /count in routes/invoices.js, yielding /invoices/count.\n- getTotalCount is implemented in controllers/invoices.js and wired to router.get('/count', getTotalCount), so only GET is explicitly supported.\n- HEAD is typically handled by Express for GET routes, so it is considered acceptable based on framework behavior (even though not explicitly defined in code).\n- OPTIONS is effectively supported due to the global CORS middleware, which handles preflight requests.\n- All other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) have no corresponding handlers in the provided code, so they are not acceptable for this endpoint."
