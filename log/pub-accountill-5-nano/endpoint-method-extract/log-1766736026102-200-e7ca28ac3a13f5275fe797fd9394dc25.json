        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /profiles\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - There is a GET route for /profiles (getProfilesByUser). Express will also satisfy HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler.\n\n- POST: true\n  - POST /profiles is defined and handled by createProfile.\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - With routes defined, Express typically responds to OPTIONS for that path, indicating allowed methods. No explicit OPTIONS handler is present, but it’s covered by the framework’s default behavior for existing routes.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - No TRACE handler defined for /profiles.\n\n- GET: true\n  - GET /profiles is defined and handled by getProfilesByUser.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - No PUT /profiles route defined (PUT is not implemented for the base /profiles path).\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - No DELETE /profiles route defined (base path).\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - PATCH is defined for /profiles/:id, not for /profiles. For the base path /profiles, PATCH is not implemented.\n\nExplanation:\n- The router is mounted in index.js with app.use('/profiles', profile), so all routes defined in routes/profile.js are prefixed by /profiles.\n- On /profiles, the implemented methods are GET (getProfilesByUser) and POST (createProfile). There is no base-path PUT, DELETE, or PATCH; PATCH exists but only for /profiles/:id. Therefore, only GET and POST are explicitly implemented for /profiles, with HEAD and OPTIONS treated as supported by Express given the existing GET/POST definitions. TRACE is not implemented."
