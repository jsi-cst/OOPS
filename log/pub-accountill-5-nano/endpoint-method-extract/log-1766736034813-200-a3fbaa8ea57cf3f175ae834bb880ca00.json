        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /clients\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - Rationale: The getClients endpoint is defined as a GET route on /clients. Express automatically provides HEAD handling for GET routes, so HEAD is effectively supported for this endpoint by default.\n\n- POST: false\n  - Rationale: The POST handler on this path exists for creating a client (createClient) at /clients (same path) in routes/clients.js, but that is a separate operation. For the getClients endpoint specifically (which is GET on /clients), POST is not defined as part of its handling.\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - Rationale: The app uses the cors() middleware, which handles OPTIONS (preflight) requests for CORS. So OPTIONS is effectively supported for this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Rationale: There is no TRACE handler defined for /clients, and no code indicates TRACE support.\n\n- GET: true\n  - Rationale: The getClients function is registered with router.get('/', getClients) and the router is mounted at /clients, so the GET method on /clients is implemented.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Rationale: There is no PUT handler for /clients (PUT is not defined for the base /clients path; there is PUT-like behavior for /clients/:id elsewhere in the code, but not on /clients).\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Rationale: There is no DELETE handler for /clients (the DELETE exists for /clients/:id, not for the base /clients path).\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Rationale: There is no PATCH handler for /clients (PATCH exists for /clients/:id, not for the base /clients path).\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question is the getClients function, which is wired via router.get('/', getClients) and mounted under /clients in index.js, yielding the full path /clients for GET requests.\n- The codebase shows other methods on similar paths (POST on /clients, PATCH/DELETE on /clients/:id), but for the exact endpoint /clients with the getClients handler, only GET is defined.\n- HEAD is typically supported automatically for GET routes in Express.\n- OPTIONS is handled by the CORS middleware, so preflight OPTIONS requests are supported.\n- Other HTTP methods (TRACE, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not defined for /clients in this code."
