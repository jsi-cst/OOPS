        "content": "Here is the analysis based on the provided backend files.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /clients/{id}\n  - Rationale: In routes/clients.js, the route for deleting a client is defined as router.delete('/:id', deleteClient). This router is mounted under app.use('/clients', clientRoutes) in index.js, so the full path becomes /clients/{id} for the DELETE method.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: The only defined HTTP method for this path is DELETE. There is no wildcard or all-methods route, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no HEAD handler for /clients/{id}. Express does not imply HEAD support unless a corresponding GET route exists for the same path, which is not defined for this specific path.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: POST is not defined for /clients/{id}. The only defined method on this path is DELETE.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for this path defined in the code. Express would only respond to OPTIONS if such a route/middleware exists.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: TRACE is not defined anywhere in the codebase for this path, and there is no generic TRACE handling in the provided code.\n\n- GET acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no GET route defined for /clients/{id} (the existing GET routes are for /clients and /clients/user, but not for a specific {id} path). Therefore GET on this path is not available.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: PUT is not defined for /clients/{id}. Only DELETE is defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: true\n  - Rationale: The route router.delete('/:id', deleteClient) handles DELETE requests for /clients/{id}, and the controller deleteClient is implemented.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Rational: PATCH is not defined for /clients/{id}.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint in question is DELETE /clients/:id (with id as a path parameter). The server wires this via app.use('/clients', clientRoutes) and defines router.delete('/:id', deleteClient) in routes/clients.js. Hence the full path is /clients/{id} and only the DELETE method is implemented for this path.\n- Other HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this specific path in the provided code, so they are not acceptable according to the codebase’s current routing configuration. HEAD would only be acceptable if a GET for the same path existed (which it does not in this file), and OPTIONS/TRACE are not implemented for this route."
