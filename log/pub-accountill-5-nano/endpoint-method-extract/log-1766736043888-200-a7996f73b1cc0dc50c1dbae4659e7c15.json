        "content": "Here is the analysis based on the provided backend source code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the update endpoint:\n  - /clients/{id}\n  - Reason: routes/clients.js defines router.patch('/:id', updateClient) and index.js mounts the routes under the /clients prefix via app.use('/clients', clientRoutes). Therefore the updateClient endpoint is a PATCH request to /clients/:id, with the path parameter id wrapped as {id} for OpenAPI.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The code only defines PATCH for this path. Other methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) are not defined for /clients/{id}.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no HEAD handler defined for /clients/{id}. Express would not automatically treat PATCH as HEAD, and there is no explicit HEAD route in the code.\n\n- POST method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no POST handler for /clients/{id} in the routes; only PATCH is defined for that path.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable?\n  - Yes. The application uses the CORS middleware (app.use(cors())). CORS middleware handles preflight OPTIONS requests globally, so OPTIONS requests to /clients/{id} would be handled by the middleware.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no TRACE handler defined for this path, and TRACE is not handled by the code or middleware.\n\n- GET method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no GET handler for /clients/{id}. The existing GET routes are /clients/ and /clients/user.\n\n- PUT method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no PUT handler for /clients/{id}; only PATCH is defined for updateClient.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no DELETE handler for /clients/{id}. There is a DELETE for /clients/:id in routes, but that corresponds to deleteClient, a different operation. For the update endpoint (updateClient), DELETE is not defined.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable?\n  - Yes. PATCH is the method wired to updateClient for the path /clients/{id}.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The updateClient function is exported and wired in routes/clients.js as router.patch('/:id', updateClient), with the router mounted at /clients in index.js. This yields the full endpoint /clients/{id} using PATCH.\n- Only PATCH is defined for this specific path, so only PATCH is acceptable for the update operation.\n- OPTIONS is handled by the global CORS middleware, making OPTIONS acceptable as part of CORS preflight.\n- All other methods (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, etc.) are not defined for this path, so they are not acceptable for this endpoint."
