No other methods are implemented for this path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: No\n  - There is no GET (or explicit HEAD) handler for this path. Express will not automatically map HEAD to POST routes, so HEAD would not be served by this endpoint.\n\n- POST acceptable: Yes\n  - The signin functionality is implemented as router.post('/signin', signin), and this is mounted under /users, yielding /users/signin with POST.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: Yes (via CORS middleware)\n  - The app uses the global CORS middleware (app.use(cors())). This typically handles preflight OPTIONS requests for cross-origin calls. While there is no explicit OPTIONS route defined, the CORS middleware will respond to OPTIONS preflight requests for this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: No\n  - No TRACE handler is defined.\n\n- GET acceptable: No\n  - No GET handler is defined for this path; only POST is implemented.\n\n- PUT acceptable: No\n  - No PUT handler is defined.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: No\n  - No DELETE handler is defined.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: No\n  - No PATCH handler is defined.\n\nExplanation:\n- The only endpoint related to user sign-in is defined in routes/userRoutes.js as POST /signin, and this router is mounted at /users in index.js, so the full path for signin is /users/signin.\n- Since only POST is implemented for this route, only POST is truly acceptable. HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and TRACE are not implemented for this path.\n- OPTIONS is typically handled by the global CORS middleware to support preflight requests in cross-origin scenarios, so OPTIONS is effectively acceptable at the route level due to the cors() setup, even though there’s no explicit route for OPTIONS."
