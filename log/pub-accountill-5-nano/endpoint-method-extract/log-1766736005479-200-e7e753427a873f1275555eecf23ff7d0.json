I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `routes/clients.js`, I found that `clientRoutes` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT are not defined in routes/clients.js.\n\nAcceptable methods according to the code (true/false for each):\n- HEAD: false (not defined in the router)\n- POST: true (defined as POST /clients/)\n- OPTIONS: false (not defined)\n- TRACE: false (not defined)\n- GET: true (defined as GET /clients/ and GET /clients/user)\n- PUT: false (not defined)\n- DELETE: true (defined as DELETE /clients/{id})\n- PATCH: true (defined as PATCH /clients/{id})\n\nExplanation:\n- The Express router in routes/clients.js exports a router with the following handlers:\n  - GET '/' -> getClients\n  - GET '/user' -> getClientsByUser\n  - POST '/' -> createClient\n  - PATCH '/:id' -> updateClient\n  - DELETE '/:id' -> deleteClient\n- The router is mounted at '/clients' in index.js, so the effective routes are:\n  - GET /clients/\n  - GET /clients/user\n  - POST /clients/\n  - PATCH /clients/:id\n  - DELETE /clients/:id\n- Only the methods explicitly defined above are acceptable. HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, and PUT are not defined in this router, so they are not considered acceptable per the code. Express can sometimes handle HEAD for GET by default, but since the instruction is to rely strictly on the code, HEAD is treated as not defined here.",
