There is no handler for POST, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, etc. on /invoices/{id}.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? Yes\n  - There is a GET route for /invoices/:id (getInvoice). Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler, returning headers without a body.\n\n- POST acceptable? No\n  - There is no POST '/invoices/{id}' route (POST is defined for '/invoices' as createInvoice, not for a specific id).\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? Yes\n  - The app uses the CORS middleware (cors()) which handles OPTIONS (preflight) requests and sets appropriate headers.\n\n- TRACE acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE handler defined, and the code does not enable tracing.\n\n- GET acceptable? Yes\n  - There is a GET '/:id' route (getInvoice), so GET is supported for this path.\n\n- PUT acceptable? No\n  - There is no PUT '/:id' route defined; only PATCH and DELETE are available for that path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable? Yes\n  - There is a DELETE '/:id' route (deleteInvoice), so DELETE is supported for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable? Yes\n  - There is a PATCH '/:id' route (updateInvoice), so PATCH is supported for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint for deleteInvoice is defined in routes/invoices.js as router.delete('/:id', deleteInvoice) under the base path '/invoices' from index.js. Therefore the full path is /invoices/{id}, where {id} is the invoice identifier.\n- The code defines specific methods for that path: GET to retrieve, PATCH to update, and DELETE to delete. HEAD is not explicit but is typically handled by Express via the existing GET route. OPTIONS is handled by the CORS middleware. Other methods (POST, PUT, TRACE) are not defined for this particular path."
