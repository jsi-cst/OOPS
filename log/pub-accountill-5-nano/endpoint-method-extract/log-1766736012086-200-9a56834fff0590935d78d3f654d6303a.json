HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT are not defined in routes/clients.js.\n\nAcceptable methods according to the code (true/false for each):\n- HEAD: false (not defined in the router)\n- POST: true (defined as POST /clients/)\n- OPTIONS: false (not defined)\n- TRACE: false (not defined)\n- GET: true (defined as GET /clients/ and GET /clients/user)\n- PUT: false (not defined)\n- DELETE: true (defined as DELETE /clients/{id})\n- PATCH: true (defined as PATCH /clients/{id})\n\nExplanation:\n- The Express router in routes/clients.js exports a router with the following handlers:\n  - GET '/' -> getClients\n  - GET '/user' -> getClientsByUser\n  - POST '/' -> createClient\n  - PATCH '/:id' -> updateClient\n  - DELETE '/:id' -> deleteClient\n- The router is mounted at '/clients' in index.js, so the effective routes are:\n  - GET /clients/\n  - GET /clients/user\n  - POST /clients/\n  - PATCH /clients/:id\n  - DELETE /clients/:id\n- Only the methods explicitly defined above are acceptable. HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, and PUT are not defined in this router, so they are not considered acceptable per the code. Express can sometimes handle HEAD for GET by default, but since the instruction is to rely strictly on the code, HEAD is treated as not defined here."
