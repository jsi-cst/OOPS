In routes/clients.js, the routes that take an id are defined as:\n- PATCH '/:id' -> updateClient\n- DELETE '/:id' -> deleteClient\nSo the concrete full path for an id-based request is /clients/{id}.\n\nHTTP methods acceptance (based strictly on the code)\n- All methods acceptable: No\n  - Only PATCH and DELETE are defined for the /clients/{id} path.\n- HEAD: No\n  - There is no GET route for /clients/{id}, and Express does not automatically provide HEAD unless a corresponding GET route exists. Therefore HEAD is not acceptable for this path as implemented.\n- POST: No\n  - POST is defined only for '/clients/' (creating a new client), not for '/clients/{id}'.\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - No explicit OPTIONS handler is defined for this path.\n- TRACE: No\n  - No TRACE handler is defined.\n- GET: No\n  - There is no GET '/:id' route for /clients/{id}.\n- PUT: No\n  - No PUT '/:id' route is defined.\n- DELETE: Yes\n  - DELETE '/:id' is defined and wired to deleteClient.\n- PATCH: Yes\n  - PATCH '/:id' is defined and wired to updateClient.\n\nExplanation\n- The routes file defines two id-based operations: PATCH /:id and DELETE /:id, which correspond to /clients/{id} when mounted under the /clients prefix in index.js.\n- There are no route definitions for GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, or any other method for the /clients/{id} path, so those methods are not acceptable for this endpoint according to the code.\n- HEAD would only be automatically supported if there were a corresponding GET route for the same path; since there isn’t, HEAD is not considered acceptable here."
