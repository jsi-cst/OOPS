        "content": "Here’s the analysis based on the provided index.js:\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint: /fetch-pdf\n  - This route is defined as app.get('/fetch-pdf', ...), and it is registered directly on the app (not under another mounted path like /invoices, /clients, etc.).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - The code defines only a GET route for /fetch-pdf. Other methods are not implemented for this path.\n\n- Is the HEAD method acceptable? Yes\n  - Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler. Since /fetch-pdf has a GET handler, HEAD will be served with the appropriate headers (no body).\n\n- Is the POST method acceptable? No\n  - No app.post('/fetch-pdf', ...) handler exists.\n\n- Is the OPTIONS method acceptable? Yes\n  - The app uses the global CORS middleware (app.use(cors())). CORS middleware responds to preflight OPTIONS requests, so OPTIONS is effectively handled for this path.\n\n- Is the TRACE method acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE handler in the code, and Express does not provide TRACE support by default for this path.\n\n- Is the GET method acceptable? Yes\n  - Explicitly defined: app.get('/fetch-pdf', (req, res) => { ... }).\n\n- Is the PUT method acceptable? No\n  - Not implemented for this path.\n\n- Is the DELETE method acceptable? No\n  - Not implemented for this path.\n\n- Is the PATCH method acceptable? No\n  - Not implemented for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The only explicit HTTP method implemented for the endpoint is GET at /fetch-pdf, which serves the invoice PDF file. HEAD is implicitly supported by Express due to the GET handler. OPTIONS is effectively supported due to the global CORS middleware. All other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) have no handlers for this path, so they are not acceptable according to the code. There are no path parameters in this endpoint (no curly-brace parameters), so the path remains /fetch-pdf."
