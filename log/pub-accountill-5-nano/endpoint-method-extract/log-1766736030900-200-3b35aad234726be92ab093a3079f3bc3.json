I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `controllers/invoices.js`, I found that `getInvoicesByUser` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "Here is what the backend defines for the endpoint that uses getInvoicesByUser, considering routes mounted under /invoices.\n\n- Full HTTP request path\n  - /invoices\n\n  Note: There is no path parameter for this specific route (getInvoicesByUser is registered as router.get('/', getInvoicesByUser)). Other invoice operations use /invoices/:id, but for getInvoicesByUser the route is simply /invoices. If you include a query, it would be /invoices?searchQuery=...\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this path?\n  - No. The code defines only GET and POST (and implicitly HEAD via GET, plus OPTIONS via CORS). Other methods (PUT, PATCH, DELETE, TRACE) are not defined for the root /invoices path.\n\n- HEAD: Acceptable\n  - Yes. Since there is a GET route for /invoices, Express will handle HEAD requests for that route by default (HEAD requests to a route with a GET handler are answered similarly to GET but without a body). This is based on Express behavior in the codebase where a GET handler exists for this path.\n\n- POST: Acceptable\n  - Yes. The routes file defines router.post('/', createInvoice) under the /invoices base path, so POST /invoices is valid and will create an invoice.\n\n- OPTIONS: Acceptable\n  - Yes. The app uses app.use(cors()), which handles CORS preflight OPTIONS requests globally. Therefore OPTIONS requests to /invoices are handled through the CORS middleware.\n\n- TRACE: Acceptable\n  - No. There is no TRACE route defined for /invoices, and TRACE is not implemented in the code.\n\n- GET: Acceptable\n  - Yes. GET /invoices is explicitly defined and handled by getInvoicesByUser.\n\n- PUT: Acceptable\n  - No. There is no PUT route defined for /invoices (PUT is not registered in routes/invoices.js for the root path).\n\n- DELETE: Acceptable\n  - No. There is no DELETE route defined for /invoices (DELETE exists for /invoices/:id, but not for the root /invoices path).\n\n- PATCH: Acceptable\n  - No. PATCH is defined for /invoices/:id (i.e., /invoices/{id}) but not for the root path /invoices. So PATCH /invoices is not defined; PATCH on a root path is not acceptable per the code.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint used for getInvoicesByUser is mounted via app.use('/invoices', invoiceRoutes) and defined as router.get('/', getInvoicesByUser). Therefore the full path is /invoices, with no path parameters for this specific handler. The codebase also defines additional routes for /invoices/:id (GET, PATCH, DELETE) and /invoices/count (GET), as well as POST /invoices to create invoices, but the root GET handler itself does not involve any path parameters. The allowed methods for that path are GET and POST (and HEAD via GET, and OPTIONS via CORS); other methods are not implemented for that path.",
