PUT and POST are not defined for this path, so they are not acceptable there.\n- For /profiles, the code defines GET (getProfilesByUser) and POST (createProfile). Therefore those methods are acceptable on this path. PATCH, PUT, and DELETE are not defined for this path.\n- HEAD is not explicitly defined, but because Express provides HEAD handling for routes that have a GET handler, HEAD is effectively acceptable where a GET exists.\n- OPTIONS is generally handled by the global CORS middleware (app.use(cors())), so preflight OPTIONS requests should be answered appropriately.\n- TRACE is not implemented anywhere in the code, so it is not acceptable.\n\nIf you need an OpenAPI spec snippet based on these findings, I can generate a structured YAML/JSON for these paths and methods."
