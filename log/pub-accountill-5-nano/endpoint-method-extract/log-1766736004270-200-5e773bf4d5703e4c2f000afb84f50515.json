No\n  - Only POST is defined for this endpoint.\n\nMethod-by-method verdict (based on the code, not assumptions)\n- HEAD: Not acceptable\n  - There is no GET route for this path (which would typically map HEAD in Express). Only POST /forgot is defined.\n- POST: Acceptable\n  - The forgotPassword function is explicitly registered as the handler for POST /forgot in routes/userRoutes.js.\n- OPTIONS: Acceptable\n  - The app uses the CORS middleware (cors()), which handles OPTIONS requests globally, allowing preflight requests for the defined routes.\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - There is no TRACE handler defined for this path.\n- GET: Not acceptable\n  - No GET handler is defined for /users/forgot.\n- PUT: Not acceptable\n  - No PUT handler is defined for /users/forgot.\n- DELETE: Not acceptable\n  - No DELETE handler is defined for /users/forgot.\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n  - No PATCH handler is defined for /users/forgot.\n\nExplanation\n- The routes file shows only a POST binding for forgotPassword at the path /forgot, and this router is mounted under /users in index.js. Therefore, the full endpoint path is /users/forgot, with no path parameters.\n- Since only POST is defined, all other methods are not implemented for this path. HEAD would only be implicitly handled if a GET route existed; since it does not, HEAD is not applicable here. OPTIONS is handled by the global CORS middleware, making it acceptable. TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH have no corresponding handlers in the code."
