        "content": "Here is the analysis for the updateInvoice endpoint.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /invoices/{id}\n  - Rationale: The router defines PATCH('/:id', updateInvoice) under the invoices router, and the router is mounted at '/invoices' in index.js. Therefore the full path is /invoices/{id} with the id path parameter wrapped in braces for the OpenAPI-style path.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable?: No\n  - Rationale: The routing only defines specific methods for this path (GET, PATCH, DELETE via different routes on /invoices/:id). There is no indication that all methods are accepted on /invoices/{id}.\n\n- HEAD acceptable?: No\n  - Rationale: There is no HEAD handler for /invoices/:id in the code. Express would only have a handler for HEAD if explicitly defined or if a GET handler existed for that path and the framework applies HEAD automatically. Since only PATCH and other methods are defined for this path, HEAD is not handled by the code.\n\n- POST acceptable?: No\n  - Rationale: POST is defined for creating invoices at /invoices (the root of the invoices router), not for /invoices/{id}. The path in question does not have a POST handler.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable?: No\n  - Rationale: There is no OPTIONS handler defined for /invoices/{id} in the code.\n\n- TRACE acceptable?: No\n  - Rationale: There is no TRACE handler defined, and TRACE is typically not implemented in this project’s routes.\n\n- GET acceptable?: Yes\n  - Rationale: The route router.get('/:id', getInvoice) provides GET on /invoices/:id, so GET is supported for this path.\n\n- PUT acceptable?: No\n  - Rationale: There is no PUT handler for /invoices/:id; only PATCH, GET, and DELETE exist for this path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable?: Yes\n  - Rationale: The route router.delete('/:id', deleteInvoice) provides DELETE on /invoices/:id, so DELETE is supported for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable?: Yes\n  - Rationale: The route router.patch('/:id', updateInvoice) provides PATCH on /invoices/:id, and this is the endpoint in question.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint for updating an invoice is defined in routes/invoices.js as PATCH('/:id', updateInvoice) under the invoices router, which itself is mounted at '/invoices' in index.js. This yields the final path /invoices/{id} for the update operation.\n- The code shows explicit handlers for GET, PATCH, and DELETE on /invoices/:id, but no handlers for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, or POST on that same path. Therefore, only GET, PATCH, and DELETE are acceptable for /invoices/{id}, with all other methods not supported by this route."
