I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `index.js`, I found that `anonymous` is implemented to process HTTP requests to the path `/fetch-pdf`. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "Here’s the analysis based on the provided index.js:\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint: /fetch-pdf\n  - This route is defined as app.get('/fetch-pdf', ...), and it is registered directly on the app (not under another mounted path like /invoices, /clients, etc.).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - The code defines only a GET route for /fetch-pdf. Other methods are not implemented for this path.\n\n- Is the HEAD method acceptable? Yes\n  - Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler. Since /fetch-pdf has a GET handler, HEAD will be served with the appropriate headers (no body).\n\n- Is the POST method acceptable? No\n  - No app.post('/fetch-pdf', ...) handler exists.\n\n- Is the OPTIONS method acceptable? Yes\n  - The app uses the global CORS middleware (app.use(cors())). CORS middleware responds to preflight OPTIONS requests, so OPTIONS is effectively handled for this path.\n\n- Is the TRACE method acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE handler in the code, and Express does not provide TRACE support by default for this path.\n\n- Is the GET method acceptable? Yes\n  - Explicitly defined: app.get('/fetch-pdf', (req, res) => { ... }).\n\n- Is the PUT method acceptable? No\n  - Not implemented for this path.\n\n- Is the DELETE method acceptable? No\n  - Not implemented for this path.\n\n- Is the PATCH method acceptable? No\n  - Not implemented for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The only explicit HTTP method implemented for the endpoint is GET at /fetch-pdf, which serves the invoice PDF file. HEAD is implicitly supported by Express due to the GET handler. OPTIONS is effectively supported due to the global CORS middleware. All other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) have no handlers for this path, so they are not acceptable according to the code. There are no path parameters in this endpoint (no curly-brace parameters), so the path remains /fetch-pdf.",
