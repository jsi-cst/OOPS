It uses a query parameter named searchQuery (e.g., /clients/user?searchQuery=abc).\n\nHTTP methods acceptance (based strictly on the code)\n\n- All methods acceptable: false\n  - Only GET is defined for this exact path. Other HTTP methods are not implemented for /clients/user.\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - Because Express defines a GET route for /clients/user, HEAD requests are automatically handled by Express (they return the same headers as GET, without the body). This behavior comes from Express, not from explicit HEAD route code.\n\n- GET: true\n  - Explicitly defined in routes/clients.js as router.get('/user', getClientsByUser) and implemented in controllers/clients.js.\n\n- POST: false\n  - No POST route for /clients/user. The only POST defined for /clients is at /clients/ (creating a client).\n\n- PUT: false\n  - No PUT route for /clients/user. PUT is not defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - No PATCH route for /clients/user. PATCH is not defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - No DELETE route for /clients/user. DELETE is not defined for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - OPTIONS is handled via the global CORS middleware (app.use(cors())). This middleware responds to preflight OPTIONS requests with appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Methods headers. No explicit OPTIONS route is needed for this to be acceptable.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - No TRACE route is defined for this path, and there is no code in place to handle TRACE.\n\nSummary explanation\n- The backend mounts the clients router at /clients. Within that router, the only route that maps to getClientsByUser is GET /user. Therefore, the endpoint for fetching clients by user is /clients/user with GET. HEAD is implicitly supported by Express for GET routes, and OPTIONS is supported via the CORS middleware. All other methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, TRACE) are not defined for this specific path, so they are not acceptable for this endpoint."
