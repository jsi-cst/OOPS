I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `controllers/invoices.js`, I found that `createInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "- Full HTTP request path for the createInvoice endpoint: /invoices\n  - There is a router mounted at '/invoices' and createInvoice is registered on the POST method for the base path '/'. Therefore the full path for creating an invoice is /invoices (POST).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this path?: No\n  - The code only defines specific methods for this path: GET (list by user), GET (count), POST (create). Other methods like PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS are not explicitly defined for the /invoices path (though some are handled indirectly or by middleware). Therefore not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: Acceptable? Yes\n  - There is a GET route for /invoices (getInvoicesByUser) and Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler. Since /invoices has a GET handler, HEAD is effectively acceptable.\n\n- POST: Acceptable? Yes\n  - createInvoice is implemented and registered as POST on /invoices. It saves a new invoice and returns 201 on success.\n\n- OPTIONS: Acceptable? Yes\n  - The app uses the cors middleware (app.use(cors())). CORS middleware handles OPTIONS requests (preflight) for routes globally, so OPTIONS is effectively acceptable for this path.\n\n- TRACE: Acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE handler defined for /invoices, and there is no code or middleware to enable TRACE for this path.\n\n- GET: Acceptable? Yes\n  - GET /invoices is defined (getInvoicesByUser), and GET is used for other invoice-related routes as well (e.g., /invoices/:id). For the base path /invoices, GET is implemented.\n\n- PUT: Acceptable? No\n  - There is no PUT handler defined for /invoices (PUT is not registered in routes/invoices.js for the base path).\n\n- DELETE: Acceptable? No\n  - There is no DELETE handler defined for /invoices (DELETE is not registered for the base path; it exists for /invoices/:id).\n\n- PATCH: Acceptable? No\n  - There is a PATCH handler for /invoices/:id, but not for the base path /invoices. Since the endpoint in question is the createInvoice endpoint at /invoices, PATCH on this path is not defined.\n\nExplanation\n- The createInvoice function is wired in routes/invoices.js as router.post('/', createInvoice), and routes are mounted at app.use('/invoices', invoiceRoutes) in index.js. This makes the full path for the endpoint /invoices with the POST method.\n- The codebase defines additional methods for related paths:\n  - GET /invoices (getInvoicesByUser)\n  - GET /invoices/count (getTotalCount)\n  - GET /invoices/:id (getInvoice)\n  - PATCH /invoices/:id (updateInvoice)\n  - DELETE /invoices/:id (deleteInvoice)\n- HEAD is effectively supported because GET routes exist for /invoices and /invoices/:id, and Express handles HEAD automatically for routes with GET handlers.\n- OPTIONS is effectively supported due to the global CORS middleware.\n- TRACE, PUT, DELETE (for /invoices), and PATCH (for /invoices) are not defined for the target base path, hence not acceptable for the createInvoice endpoint.",
