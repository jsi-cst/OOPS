        "content": "Full HTTP request path\n- /invoices/{id}\n\nWhy:\n- The invoices router is mounted at /invoices in index.js (app.use('/invoices', invoiceRoutes)).\n- In routes/invoices.js, the endpoint for retrieving a single invoice is defined as router.get('/:id', getInvoice).\n- Therefore, the full path for getInvoice is /invoices/:id, and per the requirement, path parameters are shown as {id} -> /invoices/{id}.\n\nHTTP methods analysis (based on code)\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: No\n  - The endpoint is only implemented for GET (and also supports other methods like PATCH/DELETE on the same path in the router, but those are distinct handlers). There is no universal acceptance of all methods for this single path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: Yes\n  - Express automatically supports HEAD requests for routes defined with GET. Since getInvoice is a GET route, HEAD requests to /invoices/{id} will be handled by Express without an explicit handler.\n\n- POST acceptable: No\n  - There is no POST route defined for /invoices/{id}. The POST route exists for /invoices (createInvoice) but not for a specific /invoices/{id} path.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: Yes\n  - The app uses the CORS middleware (app.use(cors())). CORS handles preflight OPTIONS requests, so OPTIONS requests to this path are handled by the middleware.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: No\n  - There is no TRACE handler anywhere in the code, and Express does not provide TRACE for this path by default.\n\n- GET acceptable: Yes\n  - The endpoint is explicitly defined as router.get('/:id', getInvoice).\n\n- PUT acceptable: No\n  - There is no PUT route defined for /invoices/{id}. The code uses PATCH (and DELETE) for that path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: Yes\n  - The router defines router.delete('/:id', deleteInvoice), so DELETE /invoices/{id} is supported.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: Yes\n  - The router defines router.patch('/:id', updateInvoice), so PATCH /invoices/{id} is supported.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint that processes getInvoice is wired through the invoices router under the /invoices base path. The getInvoice function handles GET requests to /invoices/{id} and returns the invoice by ID.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable because Express provides automatic HEAD support for GET routes.\n- OPTIONS is acceptable due to the Cors middleware handling preflight requests.\n- Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT) are not applicable to /invoices/{id} based on the explicit routes defined; PATCH and DELETE are defined and therefore acceptable for this path.\n- TRACE is not implemented anywhere, so it is not acceptable."
