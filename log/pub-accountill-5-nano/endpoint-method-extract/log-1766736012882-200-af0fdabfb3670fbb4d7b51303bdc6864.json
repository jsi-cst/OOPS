        "content": "Here is the analysis for the anonymous endpoint handling HTTP requests to /send-pdf based on the provided index.js.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /send-pdf\n  - There are no path parameters for this endpoint, so it is exactly /send-pdf (no curly-braced parameters).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - The code defines only app.post('/send-pdf', ...). No other methods are implemented for this path.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No\n  - There is no handler for HEAD on /send-pdf. Express will not provide HEAD for this POST route unless a GET handler exists or additional HEAD handling is added; the code does not define one.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? Yes\n  - The endpoint is explicitly defined with app.post('/send-pdf', (req, res) => { ... }).\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? Yes (via CORS)\n  - The app uses global CORS middleware: app.use(cors()). This middleware handles preflight OPTIONS requests for CORS-enabled routes, so OPTIONS requests to this path are acceptable.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE handler defined anywhere in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No\n  - There is no GET handler for /send-pdf. There is a GET for root (/) and other routes, but not for /send-pdf.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No\n  - No PUT handler is defined for /send-pdf.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - No DELETE handler is defined for /send-pdf.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - No PATCH handler is defined for /send-pdf.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question is defined as a POST route at /send-pdf, which handles PDF generation and emailing. There are additional routes for POST /create-pdf and GET /fetch-pdf, but none of these affect the /send-pdf path.\n- The global CORS middleware enables handling of OPTIONS preflight requests, so OPTIONS is acceptable even without an explicit OPTIONS route.\n- HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and TRACE are not implemented for /send-pdf in the provided code, so they are not acceptable for this endpoint."
