There are no path parameters in this route.\n\nHTTP methods analysis (based on code, not assumptions)\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Only GET is defined for /clients/user (no handlers for POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc. on this path).\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - Express automatically supports HEAD for GET routes by reusing the same handler and returning headers with no body. Since there is a GET handler for /clients/user, HEAD is effectively supported.\n\n- POST: false\n  - There is no POST handler for /clients/user (POST is defined for /clients/ in the code, but not for /clients/user).\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - The app uses the global CORS middleware (app.use(cors())). This middleware handles OPTIONS preflight requests, so OPTIONS for this path are effectively supported.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - There is no TRACE handler defined in the code, and there is no mechanism in this setup to support TRACE for this route.\n\n- GET: true\n  - GET /clients/user is defined and handled by getClientsByUser.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - No PUT handler for /clients/user.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - No DELETE handler for /clients/user.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - No PATCH handler for /clients/user (though PATCH exists for /clients/:id at the same router, it does not apply to /clients/user).\n\nExplanation\n- The route hierarchy is: base prefix /clients from index.js, then /user from routes/clients.js, resulting in /clients/user.\n- The code registers only a GET handler for /clients/user, so only GET (and by extension HEAD due to Express behavior) are acceptable for this exact path.\n- OPTIONS is handled by the global CORS middleware, so preflight requests for this path are supported.\n- Other HTTP methods are not defined for this path, hence not acceptable."
