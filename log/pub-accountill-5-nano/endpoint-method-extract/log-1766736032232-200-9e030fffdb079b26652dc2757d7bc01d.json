        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /profiles/{id}\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Only PATCH is explicitly implemented for /profiles/{id}. Other methods are not defined for this path in the router (except GET/DELETE which exist for the same base path with different routes).\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - There is a GET route for the same path (/profiles/:id) in the same router, so Express will handle HEAD requests for this path based on the GET handler (no explicit HEAD route is defined, but HEAD is typically served from the GET route logic).\n\n- POST: false\n  - POST is defined for /profiles (the root of the resource), not for /profiles/{id}. The updateProfile endpoint uses PATCH on /profiles/{id}.\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - The app uses the cors() middleware globally, which handles preflight OPTIONS requests and sets appropriate headers for cross-origin requests on all routes, including /profiles/{id}.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - There is no TRACE handler defined for this path, and TRACE is not handled by the code or middleware.\n\n- GET: true\n  - There is a GET route for /profiles/:id (getProfile), so GET is supported for this path.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - There is no PUT route defined for /profiles/:id.\n\n- DELETE: true\n  - There is a DELETE route defined for /profiles/:id (deleteProfile).\n\n- PATCH: true\n  - This is the actual endpoint for updating a profile: PATCH /profiles/{id} (updateProfile).\n\nExplanation:\n- The routes/profile.js file defines the relevant endpoints on the /profiles path via index.js mounting. The updateProfile function is wired to router.patch('/:id', updateProfile), which plus the base prefix results in PATCH /profiles/{id}. GET and DELETE are also available for the same path (via GET '/:id' and DELETE '/:id'), while POST is defined only for the collection (/profiles/). HEAD is not explicit but is typically served from the GET route for the same path. OPTIONS is handled by the global CORS middleware. TRACE is not implemented anywhere in the code."
