        "content": "Here is the analysis based on index.js (and how Express handles the defined routes and middleware):\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint: /\n  - There is a GET route defined for the root path '/', and no path parameters. Therefore the full path is simply \"/\". There are no curly-brace path parameters in this endpoint.\n\n- All HTTP methods are acceptable: No\n  - The code only defines a handler for GET (app.get('/')), not for all methods. So not all methods are acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: Yes\n  - Although there is no explicit app.head route, Express provides default handling for HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler. Since there is a GET handler for '/', HEAD requests are handled by the existing GET route (sans body). Therefore HEAD is acceptable based on the code.\n\n- POST: No\n  - There is no POST handler for '/' (there are POST handlers for '/send-pdf' and '/create-pdf', but not for '/'). Therefore POST is not acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS: Yes\n  - The app uses the global CORS middleware (app.use(cors())). This middleware handles OPTIONS preflight requests for routes in the app, including '/'. Thus OPTIONS is acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - There is no TRACE handler defined, and nothing in the code indicates TRACE support. Therefore TRACE is not acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - There is an explicit app.get('/', ...) handler, so GET is acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - No PUT handler is defined for '/'. Therefore PUT is not acceptable.\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - No DELETE handler is defined for '/'. Therefore DELETE is not acceptable.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - No PATCH handler is defined for '/'. Therefore PATCH is not acceptable.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The root path '/' has only a GET route defined, so only GET is explicitly handled.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable because Express treats HEAD requests for GET routes as handled automatically when no explicit HEAD route exists.\n- OPTIONS is acceptable due to the global CORS middleware that answers preflight requests.\n- Other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not handled for this endpoint by the code."
