        "content": "Here is what the code defines for the user-related endpoints and what methods are allowed based strictly on the code you provided.\n\n1) Full HTTP request paths (prefix + endpoint)\n- The user routes are mounted with the prefix /users in index.js:\n  - /users/signin (POST)\n  - /users/signup (POST)\n  - /users/forgot (POST)\n  - /users/reset (POST)\n\nNotes:\n- There are no path parameters in these endpoints, so none are wrapped in curly braces.\n\n2) Are all HTTP methods acceptable?\n- No. Only POST is defined for these endpoints. Other methods are not defined for these routes.\n\n3) HEAD method acceptable?\n- No. The code only defines POST handlers for these routes. HEAD is not explicitly defined, and for POST routes Express does not automatically provide HEAD handling.\n\n4) POST method acceptable?\n- Yes. POST is explicitly defined for /users/signin, /users/signup, /users/forgot, and /users/reset.\n\n5) OPTIONS method acceptable?\n- Yes. The app uses the CORS middleware (app.use(cors())). This middleware handles preflight OPTIONS requests, so OPTIONS is effectively acceptable for these endpoints.\n\n6) TRACE method acceptable?\n- No. There are no TRACE handlers defined for these routes.\n\n7) GET method acceptable?\n- No. There are no GET handlers defined for these routes, and GET is not automatically provided for POST routes.\n\n8) PUT method acceptable?\n- No. PUT is not defined for these routes.\n\n9) DELETE method acceptable?\n- No. DELETE is not defined for these routes.\n\n10) PATCH method acceptable?\n- No. PATCH is not defined for these routes.\n\nExplanation:\n- The prefix /users comes from app.use('/users', userRoutes) in index.js, so every route in routes/userRoutes.js is under /users.\n- The routes file defines only four POST routes, mapping to the signin, signup, forgotPassword, and resetPassword controllers.\n- Because only POST routes are defined, only POST is acceptable. OPTIONS is treated as acceptable because CORS middleware is applied globally, which handles preflight OPTIONS requests. All other standard methods (HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not defined for these endpoints and thus not acceptable based strictly on the code."
