I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `index.js`, I found that `anonymous` is implemented to process HTTP requests to the path `/create-pdf`. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /create-pdf\n  - Rationale: The route is defined in index.js as app.post('/create-pdf', ...). It is mounted at the application root (no prefix router around it), so the full path is simply /create-pdf. There are no path parameters in this route.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: Only a POST handler is defined for /create-pdf. No other HTTP methods are implemented for this path.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - Rationale: There is no HEAD handler for /create-pdf. Express will not automatically treat POST routes as supporting HEAD unless a GET route is defined; this code defines only POST.\n\n- POST: true\n  - Rationale: The route explicitly handles POST requests at /create-pdf with app.post('/create-pdf', (req, res) => { ... }).\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Rationale: There is no app.options('/create-pdf', ...) handler or global middleware routing OPTIONS for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Rationale: There is no TRACE handler defined for this path.\n\n- GET: false\n  - Rationale: There is no app.get('/create-pdf', ...) handler.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Rationale: There is no app.put('/create-pdf', ...) handler.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Rationale: There is no app.delete('/create-pdf', ...) handler.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Rationale: There is no app.patch('/create-pdf', ...) handler.\n\nExplanation:\n- The only HTTP method implemented for the anonymous endpoint is POST, as shown by app.post('/create-pdf', ...). The server does not define any other method handlers for this path, so only POST is acceptable. Since there are no explicit HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, or TRACE handlers for /create-pdf, those methods are not acceptable according to the code. The route is mounted at the application root, so there is no additional prefix to consider for the full path. Path parameters are not used in this endpoint.",
