I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/invoices/{id}` with method PATCH, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `invoiceRoutes` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method PATCH.\n\n2. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `getInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method PATCH.\n\n3. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `updateInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method PATCH.\n\n4. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `deleteInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method PATCH.\n\n5. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `invoiceRoutes` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method PATCH.\n\n6. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `getInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method PATCH.\n\n7. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `updateInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method PATCH.\n\n8. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `deleteInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method PATCH.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "Now I can see that the PATCH method for `/invoices/{id}` is mapped to the `updateInvoice` function in the controller. Let me analyze the `updateInvoice` function in detail:\n\nFrom the controller file, I can see that:\n1. The function `updateInvoice` handles the PATCH request to `/invoices/{id}`\n2. It extracts the id from the request parameters\n3. It gets the invoice data from the request body\n4. It validates the id format using `mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid`\n5. It updates the invoice using `InvoiceModel.findByIdAndUpdate`\n6. It returns the updated invoice\n\nLooking at the function, I can identify the possible responses:\n- Success response: Returns the updated invoice object with status 200 (default) or 201\n- Error response when id is invalid: Returns error message with status 404\n- Error response from the database operation: Could return other status codes\n\nLet me also check if there are any middleware or additional error handling that might affect the responses.\n\nBased on my analysis of the `updateInvoice` function:\n\n1. **Success case**: When the invoice is successfully updated, it returns the updated invoice object with a default status code (likely 200 since no explicit status is set before res.json).\n\n2. **Invalid ID case**: When the ID is not a valid ObjectId, it returns a 404 status with the message 'No invoice with that id'.\n\n3. **Database error case**: If there's an error during the update operation, it would likely result in a 500 error or similar, though not explicitly handled in the code.\n\nLet me also check what the default status code would be when `res.json()` is called without an explicit status.\n\nIn Express.js, if no status code is explicitly set before `res.json()`, it defaults to 200. So the successful update will return status 200 with the updated invoice object.\n\nNow I can generate the response objects for the PATCH method on `/invoices/{id}`:\n\nThe final generated result begins\n```json\n{\n  \"200\": {\n    \"description\": \"Invoice updated successfully\",\n    \"schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"_id\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        },\n        \"__v\": {\n          \"type\": \"integer\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"404\": {\n    \"description\": \"No invoice with that id or Invoice not found\",\n    \"schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"message\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
