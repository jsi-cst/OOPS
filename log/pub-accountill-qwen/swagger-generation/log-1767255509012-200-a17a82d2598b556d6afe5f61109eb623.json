I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/invoices/{id}` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `invoiceRoutes` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n2. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `getInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n3. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `updateInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n4. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `deleteInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n5. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `invoiceRoutes` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n6. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `getInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n7. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `updateInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n8. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `deleteInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices/{id}` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a list of Parameter Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].parameters) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the list of Parameter Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

From the provided information and code, I can see that the `getInvoice` function handles GET requests to `/invoices/{id}`.\n\nLooking at the `getInvoice` function:\n```javascript\nexport const getInvoice = async (req, res) => { \n    const { id } = req.params;\n\n    try {\n        const invoice = await InvoiceModel.findById(id);\n        \n        res.status(200).json(invoice);\n    } catch (error) {\n        res.status(409).json({ message: error.message });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe function extracts the `id` parameter from `req.params`, which means there's a path parameter named `id` required for this endpoint. This parameter is used to identify which invoice to retrieve by its ID.\n\nLet me check if there are any other parameters used by examining the route definitions. I need to find where the routes are defined to see if there are any query parameters or other parameters associated with this endpoint.\n\n",
