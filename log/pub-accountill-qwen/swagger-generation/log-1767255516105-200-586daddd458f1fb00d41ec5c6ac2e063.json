I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/invoices` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `getInvoicesByUser` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices` with HTTP method GET.\n\n2. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `createInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices` with HTTP method GET.\n\n3. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `getInvoicesByUser` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices` with HTTP method GET.\n\n4. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `createInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a list of Parameter Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].parameters) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the list of Parameter Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "I need to analyze the information provided and the code to understand the endpoints correctly. There seems to be some confusion in the initial information provided - it mentions both `getInvoicesByUser` and `createInvoice` handling GET requests to `/invoices`, which is contradictory. Let me examine the code to clarify the actual endpoints.\n\nFrom the code in `controllers/invoices.js`, I can see:\n\n1. `getInvoicesByUser` - This function handles requests that use `req.query.searchQuery` to filter invoices by creator\n2. `createInvoice` - This function handles requests that use `req.body` to create a new invoice (this would typically be a POST request)\n3. `getInvoices` - This function retrieves all invoices without any query parameters\n4. Other functions handle different endpoints with `req.params.id`\n\nBased on the initial information stating that `/invoices` with GET method is handled by `getInvoicesByUser`, I need to identify the parameters for this endpoint. The function uses `req.query.searchQuery`, which means there's a query parameter called `searchQuery`.\n\nLet me look for any route definitions to confirm the endpoint mapping:\n\n",
