I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/invoices` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `getInvoicesByUser` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices` with HTTP method GET.\n\n2. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `createInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices` with HTTP method GET.\n\n3. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `getInvoicesByUser` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices` with HTTP method GET.\n\n4. In `controllers/invoices.js`, `createInvoice` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/invoices` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

It states that both `getInvoicesByUser` and `createInvoice` handle GET requests to `/invoices`, which is impossible - one endpoint with one method can't have two different handlers.\n\n2. Looking at the controller code, I can see that:\n   - `getInvoicesByUser` is likely for GET `/invoices` with a search query parameter\n   - `createInvoice` would typically be for POST `/invoices` (not GET as mentioned)\n   - There's also `getInvoices` function which might be for GET `/invoices` to get all invoices\n\nLet me check the routes file to understand the actual mapping:\n\n",
