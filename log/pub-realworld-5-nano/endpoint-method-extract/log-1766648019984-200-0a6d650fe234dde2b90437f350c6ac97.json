The leading group prefix is added by how ArticlesRegister is mounted. In the realworld gin app, articles routes are typically mounted under /api/articles, so the full path becomes /api/articles/{slug}/favorite.\n- Path parameter slug is represented in OpenAPI style as {slug}.\n\nHTTP methods acceptance (based on code):\n- AllMethods: false (only DELETE is registered for this path)\n- HEAD: false\n- POST: false\n- OPTIONS: false\n- TRACE: false\n- GET: false\n- PUT: false\n- DELETE: true\n- PATCH: false\n\nExplanation:\n- The code registers a single route for this endpoint: DELETE \"/:slug/favorite\" within the ArticlesRegister router group. That means only the DELETE method is implemented for this path.\n- There is no GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, or other method handler defined for /{slug}/favorite in this file.\n- HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE are not explicitly implemented in code for this path. In gin, unless a route is defined for a method, those methods are not guaranteed to be handled by code. Therefore, based strictly on the source, they are not accepted for this endpoint.\n- The full path includes the likely base prefix (e.g., /api/articles) plus the per-route path /{slug}/favorite, yielding /api/articles/{slug}/favorite."
