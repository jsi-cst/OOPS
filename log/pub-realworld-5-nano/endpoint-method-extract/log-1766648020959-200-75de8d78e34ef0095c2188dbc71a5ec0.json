        "content": "Here is the analysis for the ProfileUnfollow endpoint based on the provided code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /profiles/{username}/follow\n  - Reasoning: ProfileUnfollow is registered on router.DELETE(\"/:username/follow\") inside the ProfileRegister group. The project’s common pattern (as seen in the RealWorld Go/Gin example) mounts ProfileRegister under the /profiles prefix, so the full path becomes /profiles/{username}/follow. The username path parameter is wrapped in curly braces as required.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: Only POST and DELETE are registered for the /profiles/:username/follow path (via ProfileFollow for POST and ProfileUnfollow for DELETE). No other methods are registered for this specific path.\n\n- HEAD: No\n  - Reasoning: There is no handler for HEAD on this path in the code. HEAD would typically be handled only if a GET handler exists for the same path; it does not here.\n\n- POST: Yes\n  - Reasoning: The code registers router.POST(\"/:username/follow\", ProfileFollow) in ProfileRegister, so POST is explicitly handled on this path (to follow).\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Reasoning: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for this path in the code. The code does not indicate handling OPTIONS beyond what is registered.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reasoning: No TRACE handler is defined for this path.\n\n- GET: No\n  - Reasoning: There is a GET handler for \"/profiles/:username\" (ProfileRetrieve) but not for \"/profiles/:username/follow\". This path specifically does not have a GET handler.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - Reasoning: Not registered for this path.\n\n- DELETE: Yes\n  - Reasoning: The code registers router.DELETE(\"/:username/follow\", ProfileUnfollow, so DELETE is explicitly handled on this path (to unfollow).\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reasoning: Not registered for this path.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint in question is the follow/unfollow path under the profiles namespace. The code shows both POST and DELETE handlers for /profiles/:username/follow, corresponding to following (POST) and unfollowing (DELETE). There are no handlers for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, or PATCH on this exact path, so only POST and DELETE are acceptable methods for this endpoint per the code. The path parameter is {username}, and the full path includes the profiles prefix: /profiles/{username}/follow."
