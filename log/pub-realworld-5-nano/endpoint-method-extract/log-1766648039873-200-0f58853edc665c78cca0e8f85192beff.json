        "content": "Here is the determined OpenAPI-path and allowed methods for the UserUpdate endpoint, based on the provided code in users/routers.go and related handlers.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/user\n  - Reasoning: UserUpdate is registered in the UserRegister group at the route GET(\"/\") and PUT(\"/\"). The corresponding path for the “current user” resource in this project’s structure is /api/user (the GET on /api/user is UserRetrieve, and PUT on /api/user is UserUpdate). There are no path parameters in this route, so no {} parameters are needed.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: No\n  - Reasoning: Only GET and PUT are registered for this route within UserRegister. No other methods are mapped to this path.\n\n- HEAD: No\n  - Reasoning: There is no explicit HEAD handler defined for this path in the code provided.\n\n- POST: No\n  - Reasoning: POST is not registered for this route (only GET and PUT are registered).\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Reasoning: OPTIONS is not defined in the code for this path.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reasoning: TRACE is not defined in the code for this path.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Reasoning: GET is registered for the same path (GET \"/\"), handled by UserRetrieve.\n\n- PUT: Yes\n  - Reasoning: PUT is registered for the same path (PUT \"/\"), handled by UserUpdate.\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Reasoning: DELETE is not registered for this path.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reasoning: PATCH is not registered for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question is tied to the UserRegister router group where two routes are defined: GET \"/\" mapped to UserRetrieve and PUT \"/\" mapped to UserUpdate. Since the group path is typically something like \"/api/user\" (to align with the realworld-style structure), the full path for these operations is /api/user.\n- There are no path parameters required by this endpoint (hence no curly braces in the path).\n- Method support is strictly limited to the methods registered in the router: GET and PUT. The code does not register HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, DELETE, or PATCH for this path, so those are not acceptable according to the code."
