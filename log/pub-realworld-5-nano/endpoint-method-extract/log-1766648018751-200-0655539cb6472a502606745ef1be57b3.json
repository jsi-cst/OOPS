        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /articles/{slug}\n  - Explanation: ArticleDelete is registered under ArticlesRegister with router.DELETE(\"/:slug\", ArticleDelete). The ArticlesRegister function implies the endpoint lives under the articles router group, so the concrete path is /articles/{slug}. If the articles router is mounted under a different base (e.g., /api/articles), the final path would be that base plus /articles/{slug}. However, from this file alone, the local prefix is articles, giving /articles/{slug}.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: Only the DELETE method is registered for this endpoint. There is no support for all methods, nor is there a catch-all method handler in this route.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: There is no HEAD handler or automatic HEAD behavior defined for this DELETE route in the code. Therefore, HEAD is not considered acceptable for this endpoint based on the code.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: The ArticleDelete endpoint handles DELETE only; there is no POST mapping for /articles/{slug} in ArticleDelete.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: There is no OPTIONS handler registered for this endpoint in the code. Unless the framework provides a default OPTIONS response, the code does not indicate OPTIONS support for this path.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: No TRACE handling is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: The DELETE route does not handle GET. The GET method is handled by a different route (anonymous GET \"/:slug\" -> ArticleRetrieve), but not for the DELETE endpoint.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: The DELETE route does not handle PUT; PUT is used for ArticleUpdate at the same path, but that’s a different handler and route (still under /articles/{slug}, but tied to PUT). For the ArticleDelete endpoint specifically, PUT is not acceptable.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: true\n  - Explanation: The ArticleDelete function is registered for DELETE on the path \"/:slug\" within the articles router group, making DELETE the acceptable method for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: No PATCH handler is defined for this endpoint.\n\nNotes:\n- If the articles router is mounted under a different base path (for example, /api/articles), the full path would be that base path plus /articles/{slug}. The explanation above uses the most direct interpretation from the provided code: /articles/{slug}."
