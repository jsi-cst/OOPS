This implies the full path includes the typical articles prefix, resulting in /api/articles/{slug}/comments.\n- Since only a GET route is registered for this endpoint, only GET is explicitly supported. All other HTTP methods are not defined for this path in the code, hence they are not acceptable.\n- HEAD is not explicitly implemented, but since there is a GET route for the same path, the framework (Gin) will generally support HEAD requests by delegating to the GET handler. Therefore, HEAD is treated as acceptable here.\n- Other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this endpoint in the provided code, so they are not acceptable."
