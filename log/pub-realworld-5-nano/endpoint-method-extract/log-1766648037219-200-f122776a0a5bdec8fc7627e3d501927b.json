        "content": "Here is what the code defines for the profile endpoint and the resulting OpenAPI-like method coverage.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/profiles/{username}\n  - Rationale: ProfileRetrieve is registered in ProfileRegister with GET on \"/:username\". In the typical project structure (as per the realworld Go Gin example), ProfileRegister is mounted under the /api/profiles prefix, yielding /api/profiles/{username} for the ProfileRetrieve endpoint. The path parameter is {username} as required.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: No\n  - The code defines only three concrete routes for profile-related actions:\n    - GET /api/profiles/{username} -> ProfileRetrieve\n    - POST /api/profiles/{username}/follow -> ProfileFollow\n    - DELETE /api/profiles/{username}/follow -> ProfileUnfollow\n  - There is no catch-all or an explicit allowance for every method; therefore not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: Yes (acceptable)\n  - The code does not define an explicit HEAD handler for this path, but GET is defined for the same base path. In Gin (and most Go HTTP routers), HEAD requests for a GET route are typically handled by the framework automatically (delegating to the GET handler). Based on the presence of a GET route for the same path, HEAD would be acceptable.\n\n- POST: Yes\n  - Explicitly defined as POST /api/profiles/{username}/follow → ProfileFollow.\n\n- OPTIONS: No (not explicitly defined)\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS handler defined for these routes.\n\n- TRACE: No (not explicitly defined)\n  - There is no TRACE handler defined for these routes.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Explicitly defined as GET /api/profiles/{username} → ProfileRetrieve.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - There is no PUT handler for the profile routes (PUT is not defined in ProfileRegister for /{username}).\n\n- DELETE: Yes\n  - Explicitly defined as DELETE /api/profiles/{username}/follow → ProfileUnfollow.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - There is no PATCH handler for the profile routes.\n\nExplanation:\n- The ProfileRegister function wires three routes on its router group: a GET for retrieving a profile by username, a POST for following a user, and a DELETE for unfollowing a user. The path for the GET route uses the username as a path parameter, i.e., \"/:username\" inside the group. When mounted under the common API prefix and the profiles group (as in the realworld Go Gin setup), the full path becomes \"/api/profiles/{username}\" for retrieval, and \"/api/profiles/{username}/follow\" for follow/unfollow actions.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable because the GET route exists for the same path, and the framework typically handles HEAD automatically; however, there is no explicit HEAD handler in the code.\n- Other HTTP methods (OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, PATCH) are not implemented for these routes in the provided code."
