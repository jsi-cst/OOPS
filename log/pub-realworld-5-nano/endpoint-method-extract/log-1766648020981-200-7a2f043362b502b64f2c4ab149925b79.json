No other methods are mapped to this path.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - Reason: There is no HEAD handler registered for this path; only DELETE is registered.\n\n- POST: false\n  - Reason: The route for this path is not registered for POST.\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Reason: The code does not register an OPTIONS method for this path; no automatic acceptance is assumed from the code.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Reason: The route does not register TRACE; not handled by code.\n\n- GET: false\n  - Reason: The route is not registered for GET; only DELETE is registered.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Reason: The route is not registered for PUT.\n\n- DELETE: true\n  - Reason: The ArticleCommentDelete handler is registered exactly with router.DELETE(\"/:slug/comments/:id\", ArticleCommentDelete).\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Reason: The route is not registered for PATCH.\n\nExplanation:\n- ArticleCommentDelete is implemented and registered in ArticlesRegister with the DELETE method for the path \"/:slug/comments/:id\" relative to the articles router group. Therefore, only DELETE is supported for that endpoint. The full path combines the router prefix (commonly /api/articles) with the relative path, resulting in /api/articles/{slug}/comments/{id} in typical project wiring. Since there are no registrations for other methods (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) for this path in the provided code, those methods are not considered acceptable for this endpoint."
