        "content": "- Full HTTP request path (with correct prefix and curly brace parameter): /articles/{slug}\n  - Rationale: ArticleUpdate is registered as router.PUT(\"/:slug\", ArticleUpdate) inside the articles routes. The base prefix for articles is typically /articles, so the full path for updating an article identified by slug is /articles/{slug}. If the application has an additional API prefix (e.g., /api), that would further prefix the path, but from this file alone the concrete common base is /articles.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - Only the PUT method is registered for this path.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No\n  - There is no HEAD handler registered for this route in the code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No\n  - POST is not registered for this path (POST is used for creating at /articles, not for updating at /articles/{slug}).\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - Not registered in the code for this path.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - Not registered in the code for this path.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No\n  - GET is handled by a different route (e.g., GET /articles/{slug} for retrieval), not by the update route.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? Yes\n  - PUT is explicitly registered for this path to perform the update.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - DELETE is registered for /articles/{slug} in this file only if there were a DELETE route here; however ArticleUpdate itself is PUT, and the delete route is defined as router.DELETE(\"/:slug\", ArticleDelete) in the same ArticlesRegister, but that is a separate endpoint. For the specific ArticleUpdate endpoint, DELETE is not acceptable.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Not registered for this route.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question is ArticleUpdate, wired as PUT on the path \"/:slug\" within the ArticlesRegister router group. This means the only HTTP method officially supported for this endpoint is PUT, and the path includes a path parameter named slug. The typical wiring in this project places the articles routes under the /articles prefix, so the full path becomes /articles/{slug}. If there is an outer API prefix (like /api), that would further prefix the path, but that prefix is not visible in this file alone. All other HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not registered for this specific endpoint, so they are not acceptable for ArticleUpdate."
