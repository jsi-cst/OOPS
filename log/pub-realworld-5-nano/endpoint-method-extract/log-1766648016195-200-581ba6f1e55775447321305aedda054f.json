        "content": "Here is the OpenAPI-relevant information for the TagList endpoint derived from the provided code and typical project structure.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/tags\n  - Rationale: TagsAnonymousRegister registers GET on \"/\" for the tags group. This group is conventionally mounted under /api/tags in this project’s structure (the realworld/gin example uses /api/tags). Since there are no path parameters, the full path is simply /api/tags.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Only GET is registered for this endpoint.\n\n- Is the HEAD method acceptable? No\n  - The code only registers GET for this path (router.GET(\"/\", TagList)); HEAD is not explicitly registered.\n\n- Is the POST method acceptable? No\n  - Not registered in this route.\n\n- Is the OPTIONS method acceptable? No\n  - Not registered in this route.\n\n- Is the TRACE method acceptable? No\n  - Not registered in this route.\n\n- Is the GET method acceptable? Yes\n  - GET is explicitly registered and handled by TagList.\n\n- Is the PUT method acceptable? No\n  - Not registered.\n\n- Is the DELETE method acceptable? No\n  - Not registered.\n\n- Is the PATCH method acceptable? No\n  - Not registered.\n\nExplanation:\n- TagList is wired only via router.GET(\"/\", TagList) within TagsAnonymousRegister, which implies the endpoint supports only the GET method for its path.\n- The conventional mounting pattern in this project places the tags group under /api/tags, so the full path becomes /api/tags with no path parameters.\n- Since no other HTTP methods are registered for this route, other methods (HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not supported by the code for this endpoint."
