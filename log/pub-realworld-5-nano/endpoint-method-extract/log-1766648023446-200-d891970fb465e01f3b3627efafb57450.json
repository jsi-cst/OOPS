There are no path parameters for the ArticleCreate endpoint.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this path?\n  - No. Only POST is registered for this path.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no HEAD handler registered for this path, and the code does not indicate any automatic HEAD handling for non-GET routes.\n\n- POST method acceptable?\n  - Yes. ArticleCreate is registered for POST on \"/\".\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no OPTIONS handler registered for this path, and the code does not indicate automatic handling for OPTIONS.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no TRACE handling in the code for this path.\n\n- GET method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no GET handler registered for this path (GET is used for other paths under the same overall resource, e.g., listing or retrieving articles, but not for this POST path).\n\n- PUT method acceptable?\n  - No. Not registered for this path.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable?\n  - No. Not registered for this path.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable?\n  - No. Not registered for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The ArticlesRegister function defines these registrations: router.POST(\"/\", ArticleCreate); router.PUT(\"/:slug\", ArticleUpdate); router.DELETE(\"/:slug\", ArticleDelete); router.POST(\"/:slug/favorite\", ArticleFavorite); etc. The ArticleCreate endpoint is specifically wired only to POST on the base path (\"/\") within the articles router group.\n- There is no code registering any other HTTP method (GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) for the same base path, so those methods are not acceptable for the ArticleCreate endpoint.\n- The full path includes the common /api/articles prefix used by the anonymous and non-anonymous article routes in this project structure. The path parameters for this endpoint are none (no curly braces needed for /api/articles)."
