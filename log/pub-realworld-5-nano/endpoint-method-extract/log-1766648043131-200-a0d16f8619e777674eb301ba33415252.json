No other methods are defined.\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - The code defines a GET handler for this path (UserRetrieve). Although HEAD is not explicitly registered, many HTTP servers treat HEAD requests to a path with a GET handler as valid (the framework serves the same response with the body omitted). Since a GET handler exists, HEAD is considered acceptable based on standard HTTP behavior, even though not explicitly defined in code.\n\n- GET: true\n  - UserRetrieve is registered as the GET handler for this path.\n\n- PUT: true\n  - UserUpdate is registered as the PUT handler for this path.\n\n- POST: false\n  - There is no POST handler registered for \"/user/\".\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS handler registered for this path. The code does not provide an OPTIONS method on this route.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - No TRACE handler is registered for this path.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - There is no DELETE handler registered for this path.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - There is no PATCH handler registered for this path.\n\nExplanation\n- The Users-related routes shown include:\n  - GET \"/\" and PUT \"/\" for the User group (path prefix \"/user\"), which maps to:\n    - GET /user/ -> UserRetrieve\n    - PUT /user/ -> UserUpdate\n  - Other methods are not defined for this path, so they are not accepted by the code.\n- The HEAD method is typically handled automatically by many Go HTTP server setups when a GET handler exists; since UserRetrieve is implemented for GET, HEAD is considered acceptable by standard HTTP semantics, even though it’s not explicitly registered here.\n- OPTIONS, TRACE, POST, DELETE, PATCH are not implemented for this path, so they are not acceptable according to the code."
