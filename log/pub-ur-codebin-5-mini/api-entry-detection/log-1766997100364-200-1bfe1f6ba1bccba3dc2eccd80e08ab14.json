To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

REST endpoints are normally defined in controller classes annotated with @RestController or @Controller and placed in a controller or web package. A ServiceImpl typically uses @Service/@Component and contains business methods, not @RequestMapping/@GetMapping/@PostMapping annotations. While it’s technically possible for a developer to incorrectly place mapping annotations inside a service class, that is atypical; therefore this file is very unlikely to contain REST API endpoint definitions.\"}",
