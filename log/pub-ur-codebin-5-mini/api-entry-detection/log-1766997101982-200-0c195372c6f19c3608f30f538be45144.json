I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

REST endpoints in a Spring Boot project are normally defined in Java classes (src/main/java) annotated with @RestController/@Controller/@RequestMapping. Files in resources are typically static assets, configuration, or fixtures for tests.
