        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint implemented in app/api/cms/admin.py (specifically the first endpoint found: permissions()) and how it’s exposed through the app’s blueprints.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /cms/admin/permission\n  - Reason: The CMS blueprint is mounted with url_prefix \"/cms\" in app/__init__.py, and the admin API blueprint inside cms is mounted with url_prefix \"/admin\" in app/api/cms/__init__.py. The permissions() endpoint is defined as @admin_api.route(\"/permission\"), so the full path becomes /cms/admin/permission. There are no path parameters for this endpoint.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  - Reason: The route does not specify multiple methods; it uses the default, which is GET only (no methods=[...]). Therefore not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: True\n  - Reason: Flask automatically handles HEAD for routes that allow GET, even though HEAD is not explicitly listed. Since GET is allowed, HEAD is effectively supported.\n\n- POST: False\n  - Reason: Not defined in the route; only GET is allowed for this endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS: True\n  - Reason: Flask provides an automatic OPTIONS response for routes, even if not explicitly defined. Since GET is allowed, OPTIONS is effectively supported.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - Reason: There is no TRACE method defined or implemented for this endpoint, and Flask does not enable TRACE by default.\n\n- GET: True\n  - Reason: The endpoint is defined with route(\"/permission\") and no methods override, so it supports GET.\n\n- PUT: False\n  - Reason: Not defined for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE: False\n  - Reason: Not defined for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH: False\n  - Reason: Not defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint lives under the CMS admin blueprint, which is mounted at /cms/admin as explained above.\n- The permissions() handler does not specify methods, so it defaults to GET only.\n- Flask conventionally adds HEAD and OPTIONS handling for routes that allow GET, so HEAD and OPTIONS are effectively acceptable even though not explicitly declared.\n- All other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not supported by this endpoint as per the code."
