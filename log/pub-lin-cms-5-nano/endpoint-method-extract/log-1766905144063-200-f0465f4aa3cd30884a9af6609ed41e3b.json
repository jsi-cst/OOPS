I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/api/v1/book.py`, I found that `delete_book` is implemented to process HTTP requests to the path `/{id}`. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "Here is what the backend code defines for the delete endpoint and related methods.\n\n- Full HTTP request path (with prefix and path parameter)\n  - /v1/book/{id}\n  - Explanation: The v1 blueprint is mounted at /v1, and within it the book blueprint is mounted at /book. The delete_book endpoint uses @book_api.route(\"/<int:id>\", methods=[\"DELETE\"]), so the full path becomes /v1/book/{id} with DELETE.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No.\n  - Explanation: The delete_book function explicitly allows only DELETE for the path /v1/book/{id}. Other methods are not declared for this endpoint. However, note that there are separate routes on the same path for other methods (GET via get_book and PUT via update_book), meaning the same path supports multiple methods through different view functions, but delete_book itself is not “all methods”.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable?\n  - Yes (in practice for the same path, due to the GET route on the same path).\n  - Explanation: The GET route for /v1/book/{id} exists (get_book) and Flask/Werkzeug automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that support GET. Therefore HEAD is handled for this resource via the GET route, even though delete_book does not explicitly declare HEAD.\n\n- POST method acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Explanation: There is no POST route defined for /v1/book/{id}. The POST route defined in this file is for the collection path \"\" (i.e., /v1/book) and not for the /{id} path.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Explanation: Flask typically provides an appropriate OPTIONS response listing allowed methods for a given route. Since /v1/book/{id} is associated with GET (via get_book), PUT (via update_book), and DELETE (via delete_book), OPTIONS will be handled accordingly.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Explanation: There is no TRACE handling defined for this path.\n\n- GET method acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Explanation: The get_book endpoint is defined at /v1/book/<int:id> with no explicit methods, so GET is allowed (and HEAD/OPTIONS are automatically handled as discussed).\n\n- PUT method acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Explanation: The update_book endpoint is defined at /v1/book/<int:id> with methods=[\"PUT\"].\n\n- DELETE method acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Explanation: The delete_book endpoint is defined at /v1/book/<int:id> with methods=[\"DELETE\"].\n\n- PATCH method acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Explanation: There is no PATCH handling defined for this path.\n\nExplanation recap:\n- The endpoint for deleting a book lives at /v1/book/{id} and accepts DELETE (explicitly).\n- The same URL path also has a GET handler (get_book) and a PUT handler (update_book), so GET and PUT are supported as well on the same URL, while POST is for the collection path /v1/book (not /{id}).\n- HEAD is not defined for DELETE, but is effectively supported by the existing GET route (HEAD is automatically handled for GET routes in Flask).\n- OPTIONS is automatically provided by Flask for routes with defined methods.\n- TRACE and PATCH are not implemented for this path.",
