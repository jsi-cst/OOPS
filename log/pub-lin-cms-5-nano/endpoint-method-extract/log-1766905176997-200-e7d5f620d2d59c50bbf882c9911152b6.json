So “all methods acceptable” is False for every listed endpoint.\n\nExplanation\n- The actual paths come from the blueprint composition:\n  - CMS blueprint is mounted at /cms.\n  - User blueprint inside CMS is mounted at /user.\n  - Each function in app/api/cms/user.py is mapped to a specific subpath (register, login, empty string for the base /user path, change_password, information, refresh, permissions, captcha).\n- There are no path parameters in these routes (no {param} placeholders).\n- Acceptable methods are strictly what is declared in the @user_api.route(...) decorators:\n  - register: methods=[\"POST\"]\n  - login: methods=[\"POST\"]\n  - \"\" (the base path /user): methods=[\"PUT\"]\n  - /change_password: methods=[\"PUT\"]\n  - /information: default is GET (since no methods arg provided)\n  - /refresh: default is GET\n  - /permissions: default is GET\n  - /captcha: methods=[\"GET\",\"POST\"]\n- HEAD/GET/PUT/POST/DELETE/etc. behavior for each endpoint is deduced from Flask behavior in relation to the declared allowed methods:\n  - HEAD is effectively allowed only if GET is allowed; otherwise not. Since only GET-enabled endpoints show HEAD as True, others are False.\n  - OPTIONS is generally always supported by Flask (hence True for all endpoints).\n  - TRACE is not defined in code (False for all).\n- The explanation above is strictly based on the code, not on typical API design expectations.\n\nIf you want, I can present this as a concise OpenAPI-ready summary with each path and its allowed methods explicitly listed."
