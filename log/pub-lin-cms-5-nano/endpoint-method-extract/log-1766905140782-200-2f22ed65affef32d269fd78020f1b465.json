Hence the full path is /cms/user/information.\n- There are no path parameters in this endpoint, so no {param} placeholders are needed.\n\nHTTP methods assessment (based on code)\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No (False)\n  - The route decorator does not specify methods, so Flask defaults to GET only. It does not declare support for all methods.\n- HEAD: Yes (True)\n  - Flask automatically handles HEAD for routes that support GET. Since this endpoint supports GET by default, HEAD is automatically acceptable.\n- POST: No (False)\n  - No POST handling is defined for this route.\n- OPTIONS: Yes (True)\n  - Flask automatically handles OPTIONS for routes, returning appropriate allowed methods.\n- TRACE: No (False)\n  - TRACE is not defined or handled by this route.\n- GET: Yes (True)\n  - The route defaults to GET when methods aren’t specified.\n- PUT: No (False)\n  - Not defined for this route.\n- DELETE: No (False)\n  - Not defined for this route.\n- PATCH: No (False)\n  - Not defined for this route.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint lives under the cms blueprint at /cms, then under the cms user sub-blueprint at /user, and finally at /information, yielding /cms/user/information.\n- Because the route decorator does not specify methods, Flask uses GET by default. Therefore GET is allowed.\n- Flask provides automatic handling for HEAD (for GET routes) and OPTIONS (for all routes), so HEAD and OPTIONS are considered acceptable even though not explicitly declared in the code.\n- Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not implemented for this route, so they are not acceptable per the code. Authentication requirements (login_required) exist, but the determination here focuses solely on HTTP method support per the code."
