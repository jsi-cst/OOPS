        "content": "Analysis summary\n\n- Endpoint path (full HTTP path): /cms/file\n  - Explanation: The file API is defined in app/api/cms/file.py as a Blueprint route with path \"\" under the file_blueprint. This blueprint is mounted under cms with url_prefix=\"/file\" and that cms blueprint is mounted on the app with url_prefix=\"/cms\". Therefore, the full path is /cms/file. There are no path parameters.\n\n- Acceptable HTTP methods (overall): False\n  - Explanation: The route explicitly defines methods=[\"POST\"]. No other HTTP methods are implemented for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: False\n  - Explanation: Since only POST is defined for this route, HEAD is not explicitly allowed. In Flask/Werkzeug, HEAD is not automatically allowed unless GET (or a suitable method) is present. GET is not defined here, so HEAD should be considered not acceptable based on the code.\n\n- POST: True\n  - Explanation: The route is defined with methods=[\"POST\"] and the function post_file() handles the request.\n\n- OPTIONS: True\n  - Explanation: Flask automatically handles OPTIONS requests for routes, even if not explicitly listed, by returning the allowed methods in the response. Since POST is defined, OPTIONS would be handled accordingly by the framework.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - Explanation: There is no TRACE handling defined in the code for this endpoint, and TRACE is not provided by default.\n\n- GET: False\n  - Explanation: GET is not defined for this route; only POST is.\n\n- PUT: False\n  - Explanation: PUT is not defined for this route.\n\n- DELETE: False\n  - Explanation: DELETE is not defined for this route.\n\n- PATCH: False\n  - Explanation: PATCH is not defined for this route.\n\nExplanation of results\n\n- The OpenAPI-like assessment is based strictly on the implemented route: a POST-only endpoint at /cms/file (as part of the cms/file blueprint, under the /cms prefix). The code shows a single route with methods=[\"POST\"] and a view function post_file(), decorated with authentication and API validation. Therefore, the endpoint supports only POST. HEAD/GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH/TRACE are not implemented by this endpoint; OPTIONS is typically handled by Flask automatically, so it’s considered available."
