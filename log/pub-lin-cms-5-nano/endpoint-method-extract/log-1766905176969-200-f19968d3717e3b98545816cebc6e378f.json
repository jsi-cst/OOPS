        "content": "Here is what can be determined from the provided code in app/api/cms/__init__.py and app/__init__.py.\n\n1) Full HTTP request path for the CMS endpoint(s)\n- The create_cms() function returns a CMS Blueprint that is registered with the app under the prefix \"/cms\".\n- Within that CMS blueprint, four sub-blueprints are registered with their own prefixes:\n  - admin at /admin\n  - user at /user\n  - log at /log\n  - file at /file\n\nTherefore, the base paths you get under CMS are:\n- /cms/admin\n- /cms/user\n- /cms/log\n- /cms/file\n\nIf you have specific endpoints defined inside admin_api, user_api, log_api, or file_api, those endpoints will live under those base paths (e.g., /cms/admin/some-endpoint). The provided code does not show any path parameters in these base prefixes; any actual path parameters would come from the routes defined inside the nested blueprints.\n\n2) Are all HTTP methods acceptable (globally for this endpoint)?\n- Cannot determine from the provided code. The CMS blueprint itself does not declare allowed methods; the HTTP methods depend on the individual routes defined inside app.api.cms.admin, app.api.cms.user, app.api.cms.log, and app.api.cms.file. Those contents are not shown here.\n\n3) Is HEAD acceptable?\n- Cannot determine from the provided code. There is no explicit method allowance shown for the CMS blueprint in these snippets.\n\n4) Is POST acceptable?\n- Cannot determine from the provided code. Needs to be checked against the specific routes inside admin_api, user_api, log_api, and file_api.\n\n5) Is OPTIONS acceptable?\n- Cannot determine from the provided code. Flask typically handles OPTIONS automatically for routes, but explicit method declarations depend on the actual routes defined in the nested blueprints.\n\n6) Is TRACE acceptable?\n- Cannot determine from the provided code. TRACE is rarely used in Flask apps and would depend on whether any route explicitly allows it (and Flask’s handling for TRACE is not shown here).\n\n7) Is GET acceptable?\n- Cannot determine from the provided code. The GET allowance would be defined on individual routes inside the nested blueprints.\n\n8) Is PUT acceptable?\n- Cannot determine from the provided code. Needs inspection of the actual routes.\n\n9) Is DELETE acceptable?\n- Cannot determine from the provided code. Needs inspection of the actual routes.\n\n10) Is PATCH acceptable?\n- Cannot determine from the provided code. Needs inspection of the actual routes.\n\nExplanation\n- The only information available in the supplied files is:\n  - A CMS blueprint is created and registered at the app level with the prefix /cms.\n  - Inside the CMS blueprint, four sub-blueprints are registered with prefixes /admin, /user, /log, and /file.\n- There are no route definitions or HTTP method declarations shown in the provided snippets. Therefore, the exact full paths of individual endpoints (beyond the base prefixes) and the exact set of allowed HTTP methods must be sourced from the code inside:\n  - app.api.cms.admin\n  - app.api.cms.user\n  - app.api.cms.log\n  - app.api.cms.file\n- Without those contents, we cannot reliably declare which HTTP methods are accepted for any given endpoint, nor confirm whether methods like HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, etc. are permitted. The safe conclusion is that you should inspect the nested blueprints’ route definitions to determine the precise path patterns (including any path parameters) and the allowed methods for each route."
