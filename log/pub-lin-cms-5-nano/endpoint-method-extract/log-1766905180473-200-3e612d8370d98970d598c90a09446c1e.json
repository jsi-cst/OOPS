There are no path parameters in this endpoint.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n\n- HEAD acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: The route is defined with methods=[\"POST\"]. There is no explicit HEAD handler, and the code does not indicate HEAD support beyond the POST method.\n\n- POST acceptable: True\n  - Rationale: The route decorator specifies methods=[\"POST\"] and the function post_file() handles file upload logic.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: True\n  - Rationale: Flask automatically provides an OPTIONS response for routes, listing the allowed methods. Even though OPTIONS is not explicitly declared, it is handled by the framework for the route.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: TRACE is not defined or handled in the code for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: GET is not defined for this route (only POST is declared).\n\n- PUT acceptable: False\n\n- DELETE acceptable: False\n\n- PATCH acceptable: False\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined in app/api/cms/file.py as file_api with route \"\", which, when combined with the cms blueprint registered under url_prefix \"/cms\", results in the full path \"/cms/file\".\n- The only allowed method for this endpoint is POST, as indicated by methods=[\"POST\"] on the route decorator.\n- HEAD is not explicitly supported by the code. In Flask, HEAD is typically handled automatically only if GET (orHEAD) is supported; since only POST is declared, HEAD is not considered acceptable here.\n- OPTIONS is automatically handled by Flask for routes, so it is effectively acceptable even if not explicitly declared.\n- All other HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not supported by this endpoint based on the code."
