        "content": "- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint (with path parameter in curly braces):\n  - /v1/book/{id}\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The get_book endpoint defines the route with no explicit methods, which means it only supports GET (and, via Flask, HEAD/OPTIONS). It does not declare support for POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE, etc.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - Yes. Since the endpoint supports GET by default, Flask provides HEAD handling automatically for this route.\n\n- Is POST acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The get_book route does not declare POST as an allowed method.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - Yes. Flask automatically handles OPTIONS for routes, so this endpoint will respond to OPTIONS requests with the allowed methods.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no TRACE support defined for this route, and TRACE is not provided by default for this endpoint.\n\n- Is GET acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - Yes. The get_book endpoint is defined without an explicit methods argument, so GET is enabled by default.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The PUT method is defined for a different route (update_book) on /<int:id> with methods=[\"PUT\"]. It does not apply to this specific get_book endpoint.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The DELETE method is defined for a different route (delete_book) on /<int:id> with methods=[\"DELETE\"]. It does not apply to this specific get_book endpoint.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no PATCH method defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The get_book endpoint is implemented in app/api/v1/book.py as @book_api.route(\"/<int:id>\") under the book blueprint. This blueprint is mounted at /v1/book due to:\n  - v1 blueprint mounted at /v1 in app/__init__.py\n  - book_api blueprint mounted at /book in app/api/v1/__init__.py\n  - Therefore the full path becomes /v1/book/<id>, and the required path parameter is id.\n- The method for get_book is not explicitly restricted, so Flask treats it as GET by default. HEAD and OPTIONS are handled by Flask automatically when GET is available. Other HTTP methods are not defined for this endpoint."
