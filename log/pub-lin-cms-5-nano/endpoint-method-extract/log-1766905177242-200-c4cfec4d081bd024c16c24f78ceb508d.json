I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/api/cms/file.py`, I found that `file_api` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

There are no path parameters in this endpoint.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n\n- HEAD acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: The route is defined with methods=[\"POST\"]. There is no explicit HEAD handler, and the code does not indicate HEAD support beyond the POST method.\n\n- POST acceptable: True\n  - Rationale: The route decorator specifies methods=[\"POST\"] and the function post_file() handles file upload logic.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: True\n  - Rationale: Flask automatically provides an OPTIONS response for routes, listing the allowed methods. Even though OPTIONS is not explicitly declared, it is handled by the framework for the route.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: TRACE is not defined or handled in the code for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: GET is not defined for this route (only POST is declared).\n\n- PUT acceptable: False\n\n- DELETE acceptable: False\n\n- PATCH acceptable: False\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined in app/api/cms/file.py as file_api with route \"\", which, when combined with the cms blueprint registered under url_prefix \"/cms\", results in the full path \"/cms/file\".\n- The only allowed method for this endpoint is POST, as indicated by methods=[\"POST\"] on the route decorator.\n- HEAD is not explicitly supported by the code. In Flask, HEAD is typically handled automatically only if GET (orHEAD) is supported; since only POST is declared, HEAD is not considered acceptable here.\n- OPTIONS is automatically handled by Flask for routes, so it is effectively acceptable even if not explicitly declared.\n- All other HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not supported by this endpoint based on the code.",
