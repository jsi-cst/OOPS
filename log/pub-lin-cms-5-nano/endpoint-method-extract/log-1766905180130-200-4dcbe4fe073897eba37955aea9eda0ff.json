        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoints defined in app/api/v1/book.py and how they are wired into the overall application.\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint (with path parameter):\n  - /v1/book/{id}\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - False. The code defines specific routes with specific methods (GET on /v1/book/{id}, PUT on /v1/book/{id}, DELETE on /v1/book/{id}). It does not expose all methods for this single path.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable:\n  - True. For routes that include GET, Flask automatically provides a HEAD response. Since there is a GET route at /v1/book/{id} (get_book), HEAD is acceptable for that endpoint.\n\n- POST method acceptable:\n  - False. The POST method is defined for creating a book at /v1/book (no id). It is not defined for /v1/book/{id}.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable:\n  - True. Flask provides an OPTIONS response for routes automatically.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable:\n  - False. There is no TRACE handler defined in the code, and TRACE is not implied by the existing routes.\n\n- GET method acceptable:\n  - True. The GET method is implemented via get_book for /v1/book/{id}.\n\n- PUT method acceptable:\n  - True. The PUT method is implemented via update_book for /v1/book/{id}.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable:\n  - True. The DELETE method is implemented via delete_book for /v1/book/{id}.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable:\n  - False. There is no PATCH route defined for /v1/book/{id}.\n\nExplanation:\n- The application registers blueprints in app/__init__.py with a v1 prefix (\"/v1\") and then within app/api/v1/__init__.py the book blueprint is registered at \"/book\". Therefore the base path for book endpoints is /v1/book.\n- The specific endpoints on book_api are:\n  - GET /<int:id> → /v1/book/{id} (get_book)\n  - GET \"\" → /v1/book (get_books)\n  - GET \"/search\" → /v1/book/search (search)\n  - POST \"\" → /v1/book (create_book)\n  - PUT \"/<int:id>\" → /v1/book/{id} (update_book)\n  - DELETE \"/<int:id>\" → /v1/book/{id} (delete_book)\n- Because the prompt asks for the path with path parameters in curly braces, /v1/book/{id} is the representative endpoint path for the operations on a specific book (GET/PUT/DELETE). For POST and the non-id route, the paths are /v1/book and /v1/book/search, respectively, but the single-id path is the one used for the PUT/GET/DELETE methods. HEAD/OPTIONS behavior is derived from Flask’s default handling: HEAD is automatically supported for GET routes, OPTIONS is automatically available for all routes, while TRACE and PATCH are not implemented in this code."
