The cms blueprint is mounted under /cms and admin is mounted under /admin, giving the full path /cms/admin/group/all.\n- Flask automatically provides HEAD handling for GET routes and OPTIONS responses for routes, so HEAD and OPTIONS are effectively acceptable even though not explicitly listed in the code.\n- All other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not allowed by the route as defined."
