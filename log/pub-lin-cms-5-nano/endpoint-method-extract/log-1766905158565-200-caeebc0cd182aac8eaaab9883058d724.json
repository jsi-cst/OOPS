The admin blueprint is mounted at /admin under the cms blueprint, which is mounted at /cms, giving /cms/admin/group/{gid}.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  - Reason: The route specifies only PUT in methods.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: False\n  - Reason: HEAD is not explicitly defined for this route and Flask does not automatically enable HEAD for non-GET methods. Since the route only enables PUT, HEAD should not be treated as acceptable based on the code.\n\n- POST acceptable: False\n  - Reason: POST is not listed for this route (only PUT is defined).\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: True\n  - Reason: Flask automatically handles OPTIONS for routes, providing the allowed methods in responses. This behavior is part of Flask/Werkzeug, not explicit in the route decorators, but it is a standard framework behavior.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: False\n  - Reason: There is no TRACE method defined or supported by this route or framework configuration.\n\n- GET acceptable: False\n  - Reason: GET is not listed for this route (only PUT is defined).\n\n- PUT acceptable: True\n  - Reason: The route explicitly lists PUT in methods.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: False\n  - Reason: DELETE is not listed for this route.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: False\n  - Reason: PATCH is not listed for this route.\n\nExplanation:\n- The path is constructed by stacking the prefixes: the cms blueprint mounted at /cms, the admin blueprint mounted at /admin, and the specific route /group/<int:gid> on that blueprint, resulting in /cms/admin/group/{gid}.\n- The endpoint supports only PUT as declared in the route decorator, so only PUT is acceptable.\n- HEAD is not automatically handled for non-GET methods in Flask, so it is not considered acceptable here.\n- OPTIONS is handled by Flask automatically for any route, so it is considered acceptable.\n- All other methods (GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not defined for this endpoint and thus not acceptable."
