        "content": "Here are the determined details for the endpoint implemented in app/api/cms/log.py, taking into account how the blueprints are wired and how Flask routes work.\n\n- Full HTTP request path\n  - /cms/log\n  - Rationale: The log API is registered under the cms blueprint with url_prefix=\"/log\", and the cms blueprint itself is registered with url_prefix=\"/cms\". The route annotation in log.py for the main endpoint is @log_api.route(\"\"), which corresponds to the base path of that blueprint. Combined prefixes produce /cms/log.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Rationale: The route in log.py does not specify methods, so Flask defaults to GET only. There is no explicit allowance of all methods.\n\n- HEAD\n  - Acceptable: Yes (by framework behavior)\n  - Rationale: Flask automatically provides HEAD support for routes that allow GET. Since the endpoint supports GET (by default), HEAD is effectively supported.\n\n- GET\n  - Acceptable: Yes\n  - Rationale: The route is defined without a methods list, which defaults to GET. The function get_logs handles the request for this route.\n\n- POST\n  - Acceptable: No\n\n- PUT\n  - Acceptable: No\n\n- DELETE\n  - Acceptable: No\n\n- PATCH\n  - Acceptable: No\n\n- OPTIONS\n  - Acceptable: Yes (by framework behavior)\n  - Rationale: Flask automatically handles OPTIONS for routes, returning the allowed methods. Since this route supports GET (and thus HEAD), OPTIONS will be handled by Flask as well.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint path is derived from the cms blueprint (\"/cms\") plus the log blueprint (\"/log\"), with the specific function mapped at the base path \"\" for that blueprint, yielding /cms/log.\n- The code does not explicitly declare allowed methods, therefore only GET is explicitly supported by the route definition. HEAD and OPTIONS are not manually defined but are provided by Flask (HEAD for GET routes, OPTIONS for all routes), so they are effectively acceptable. Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not supported by the code for this route."
