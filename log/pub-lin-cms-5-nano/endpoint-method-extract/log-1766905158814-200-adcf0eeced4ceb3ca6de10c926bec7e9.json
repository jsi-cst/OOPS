(Note: some frameworks auto-handle HEAD, but per code, only POST is allowed.)\n- POST: Yes\n  - Reason: explicitly allowed by the route decorator: methods=[\"POST\"].\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Reason: not included in the allowed methods; the code does not declare OPTIONS. (Some frameworks auto-handle OPTIONS, but per code, not declared.)\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reason: not declared in allowed methods.\n- GET: No\n  - Reason: not declared in allowed methods.\n- PUT: No\n  - Reason: not declared in allowed methods.\n- DELETE: No\n  - Reason: not declared in allowed methods.\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reason: not declared in allowed methods.\n\nExplanation\n\n- The full path is constructed by stacking the blueprint prefixes: the admin_api routes under cms with cms’s prefix, and cms under the app with the top-level prefix. This yields /cms/admin/permission/dispatch/batch.\n- The allowed HTTP method is strictly what is declared in the route decorator. Since dispatch_auths is decorated with methods=[\"POST\"], only POST is considered acceptable by the code. Other methods (HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not part of the declared allowance in the code, even though some servers may respond to OPTIONS automatically; based on the code, they are not explicitly acceptable."
