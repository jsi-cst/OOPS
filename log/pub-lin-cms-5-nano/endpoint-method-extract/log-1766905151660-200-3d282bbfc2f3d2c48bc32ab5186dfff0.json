        "content": "Here is the determined OpenAPI-facing details for the endpoint implemented in app/api/cms/admin.py as get_group:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /cms/admin/group/{gid}\n  - Explanation: The endpoint is defined as /group/<int:gid> inside the admin blueprint, which is registered under the cms blueprint with prefix /cms. The cms blueprint itself is registered at /cms, so the full path becomes /cms/admin/group/{gid}.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: The route is defined without a methods argument, so Flask uses the default GET only. Other methods are not accepted by this endpoint.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? Yes\n  - Explanation: Flask automatically handles HEAD requests for GET routes unless explicitly overridden. Since this route supports GET, HEAD is effectively acceptable.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: Not allowed by the route definition (no POST method declared).\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? Yes\n  - Explanation: Flask automatically handles OPTIONS for routes, indicating allowed methods. Since GET is supported, OPTIONS is effectively acceptable.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: TRACE is not implemented or exposed by default for this route.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? Yes\n  - Explanation: The route is defined without a methods parameter, which defaults to GET.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: Not declared in the route.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: Not declared in the route.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: Not declared in the route.\n\nSummary: The endpoint path is /cms/admin/group/{gid} with only GET (and implicitly HEAD/OPTIONS) allowed. POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE are not allowed. The HEAD and OPTIONS allowances follow Flask’s default behavior for a GET-only route."
