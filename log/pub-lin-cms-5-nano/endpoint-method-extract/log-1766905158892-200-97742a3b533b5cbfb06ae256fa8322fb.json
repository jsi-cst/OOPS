        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /cms/admin/group/{gid}\n  - Explanation: The delete_group endpoint is defined as @admin_api.route(\"/group/<int:gid>\", methods=[\"DELETE\"]) in the admin blueprint. The admin blueprint is registered under cms with the prefix \"/admin\", and the cms blueprint is registered under the app with the prefix \"/cms\". Therefore the full path becomes /cms/admin/group/{gid}.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: The route explicitly allows only DELETE, so not all methods are accepted.\n\n- HEAD: False\n  - Explanation: HEAD is not explicitly handled by the code for this route. With a route defined only for DELETE, HEAD is not implemented by the endpoint itself (Flask does not automatically map HEAD to DELETE unless GET is defined; this route does not define GET).\n\n- POST: False\n  - Explanation: POST is not defined for this route.\n\n- OPTIONS: True\n  - Explanation: Flask/Werkzeug typically provides an OPTIONS response for routes, listing allowed methods. Although OPTIONS is not explicitly defined in the code, it is handled at the framework level for routes that specify methods.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - Explanation: TRACE is not defined for this route and is not provided by default by Flask for this endpoint.\n\n- GET: False\n  - Explanation: GET is not defined for this route.\n\n- PUT: False\n  - Explanation: PUT is not defined for this route (the route is restricted to DELETE).\n\n- DELETE: True\n  - Explanation: DELETE is explicitly defined in the route decorator methods=[\"DELETE\"] for /group/<int:gid>.\n\n- PATCH: False\n  - Explanation: PATCH is not defined for this route.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint is /cms/admin/group/{gid} and only supports DELETE as per the route configuration in app/api/cms/admin.py.\n- HEAD, GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, TRACE are not implemented for this specific route.\n- OPTIONS is typically handled by Flask automatically, so it is considered acceptable even though not explicitly declared in code."
