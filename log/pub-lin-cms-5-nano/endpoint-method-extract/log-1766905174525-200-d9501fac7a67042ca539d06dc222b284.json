        "content": "Here is the analysis based on the provided files.\n\nWhat is the full path prefix for the book endpoints?\n- The v1 API is mounted at /v1 (via app/__init__.py).\n- The book endpoints are mounted at /book inside the v1 blueprint.\n- Therefore, all book endpoints live under the prefix /v1/book.\n- Path parameters in OpenAPI style should use curly braces.\n\nEndpoints and their accepted HTTP methods (as defined by the code)\n- GET /v1/book/{id}\n  - Handler: get_book(id)\n  - Acceptable methods: GET\n  - Note: HEAD is automatically handled by Flask for GET routes; OPTIONS is also automatically provided.\n\n- GET /v1/book\n  - Handler: get_books()\n  - Acceptable methods: GET\n\n- GET /v1/book/search\n  - Handler: search(query)\n  - Acceptable methods: GET\n\n- POST /v1/book\n  - Handler: create_book(json)\n  - Acceptable methods: POST\n\n- PUT /v1/book/{id}\n  - Handler: update_book(id, json)\n  - Acceptable methods: PUT\n\n- DELETE /v1/book/{id}\n  - Handler: delete_book(id)\n  - Acceptable methods: DELETE\n\nWhich HTTP methods are accepted overall (and overrides)\n- All methods are not universally accepted. The code only defines explicit routes with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for the above endpoints.\n- HEAD and OPTIONS are not explicitly defined, but Flask/Werkzeug provide sensible behavior:\n  - HEAD is effectively allowed when a GET route exists (as in the GET routes above).\n  - OPTIONS is automatically handled for endpoints that exist (Flask provides an automatic options response unless disabled).\n- PATCH is not defined for any route in the provided code, so PATCH is not acceptable.\n- TRACE is not defined or handled by the code, so TRACE is not acceptable.\n\nSummary of acceptability per method (based on code)\n- All HTTP methods: No (not all methods are defined; only GET, POST, PUT, DELETE are explicitly implemented).\n- HEAD: Yes (implicit support via Flask for GET routes).\n- POST: Yes (via /v1/book, POST).\n- OPTIONS: Yes (implicit support via Flask for existing routes).\n- TRACE: No (not implemented in code).\n- GET: Yes (via /v1/book and /v1/book/{id} and /v1/book/search).\n- PUT: Yes (via /v1/book/{id}).\n- DELETE: Yes (via /v1/book/{id}).\n- PATCH: No (not implemented in code).\n\nExplanation\n- The full path prefix is /v1 (from app/__init__.py) plus /book (from app/api/v1/__init__.py), giving /v1/book as the base for all book endpoints.\n- Each endpoint’s path is derived from the route decorators:\n  - \"\" under the book blueprint becomes /v1/book\n  - \"/<int:id>\" becomes /v1/book/{id}\n  - \"/search\" becomes /v1/book/search\n- HTTP method support is determined by the methods parameter in the route decorator. If absent, Flask defaults to GET, and HEAD/OPTIONS are handled automatically for GET routes. No route defines PATCH or TRACE, so those methods are not supported by the code."
