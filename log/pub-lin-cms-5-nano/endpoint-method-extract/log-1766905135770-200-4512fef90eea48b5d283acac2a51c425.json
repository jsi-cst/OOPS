The endpoint defines @admin_api.route(\"/permission\") with no method override, so the full path is /cms/admin/permission.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  - Reason: The route does not specify methods, so Flask defaults to GET only. There is no code here that enables all methods.\n\n- HEAD: True\n  - Reason: Flask automatically supports HEAD for any route that supports GET, unless explicitly overridden. Since this route supports GET (by default), HEAD is also acceptable via Flask’s automatic handling.\n\n- POST: False\n  - Reason: The route has no POST method defined; only GET is allowed by default.\n\n- OPTIONS: True\n  - Reason: Flask automatically handles OPTIONS for routes, reflecting the permitted methods (GET in this case). So OPTIONS is acceptable.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - Reason: There is no TRACE handling in this route or Flask default behavior here; TRACE is not enabled by this code.\n\n- GET: True\n  - Reason: The route defaults to GET since methods are not specified.\n\n- PUT: False\n  - Reason: Not defined for this route.\n\n- DELETE: False\n  - Reason: Not defined for this route.\n\n- PATCH: False\n  - Reason: Not defined for this route.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint lives under /cms (from cms blueprint) and /admin (from admin blueprint), resulting in /cms/admin/permission.\n- The route decorator for /permission does not specify methods, so Flask uses the default GET only.\n- HEAD and OPTIONS are automatically supported by Flask for routes that support GET; they are not explicitly declared in the code but are provided by the framework.\n- Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not declared for this route, so they are not acceptable according to the code."
