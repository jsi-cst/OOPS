        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /cms/logs\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  Rationale: The presence of log-related query and page schemas (LogQuerySearchSchema, LogPageSchema) strongly indicates a read-only endpoint to list or search logs (typical HTTP method GET). There is no evidence in the provided code that other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) are implemented for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: True\n  Rationale: In Flask, if a route supports GET, HEAD is automatically handled as part of the same endpoint. Since the likely endpoint is a GET-based log listing, HEAD would be supported by Flask without explicit code.\n\n- POST acceptable: False\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: True\n  Rationale: Flask handles OPTIONS for routes automatically, especially when there is at least one supported method (GET in this case). No explicit override shown to disable it.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: False\n\n- GET acceptable: True\n\n- PUT acceptable: False\n\n- DELETE acceptable: False\n\n- PATCH acceptable: False\n\nExplanation:\n- The CMS blueprint is mounted with url_prefix=\"/cms\" in app/__init__.py, so any endpoint defined inside the CMS module would begin with /cms.\n- The file app/api/cms/schema/log.py provides schemas for listing and filtering logs (LogQuerySearchSchema and LogPageSchema), which strongly suggests an endpoint for retrieving logs with pagination and optional filters via query parameters. Such patterns are standard for a GET endpoint like /cms/logs (or /cms/log, depending on the CMS design).\n- There is no evidence in the provided code that any of POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH methods are implemented for this endpoint, so those methods are not acceptable based on the code shown.\n- HEAD and OPTIONS are typically provided automatically by Flask for routes that support GET, hence being acceptable as indicated."
