        "content": "Here are the determinations based on the provided code:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /cms/user/login\n  - Reason: The login endpoint is defined in app/api/cms/user.py as /login inside the user blueprint. That blueprint is mounted at /user within the cms blueprint, which itself is mounted at /cms. So the full path is /cms/user/login. There are no path parameters to wrap in {}.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: No\n  - Reason: The route is defined with methods=[\"POST\"] only.\n\n- HEAD: No\n  - Reason: Not declared in the route; only POST is declared.\n\n- POST: Yes\n  - Reason: The route explicitly lists POST in methods=[\"POST\"].\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Reason: Not declared in the route; not part of the allowed methods as per the code.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reason: Not declared in the route.\n\n- GET: No\n  - Reason: Not declared in the route.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - Reason: Not declared in the route.\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Reason: Not declared in the route.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reason: Not declared in the route.\n\nExplanation:\n- The path is constructed by nesting blueprints: the cms blueprint is mounted at /cms, and within it the user blueprint is mounted at /user. The login endpoint is defined as /login in the user blueprint, with only the POST method allowed. Therefore, the effective endpoint path is /cms/user/login and only the POST method is acceptable according to the code. Other HTTP methods are not supported by this route based on the explicit route declaration."
