False\n  - The endpoint is defined with methods=[\"PUT\"] only, so not all methods are accepted.\n\n- HEAD: False\n  - Flask only auto-handles HEAD when GET is allowed. This route does not allow GET, so HEAD is not acceptable based on the code.\n\n- POST: False\n  - Not in the allowed methods for this route.\n\n- OPTIONS: True\n  - Flask automatically handles OPTIONS for routes, and this route is defined (PUT), so OPTIONS is acceptable by the framework’s default behavior.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - Not defined or handled by this route.\n\n- GET: False\n  - Not defined for this route; only PUT is allowed.\n\n- PUT: True\n  - Explicitly allowed by methods=[\"PUT\"] in app/api/cms/user.py.\n\n- DELETE: False\n  - Not defined for this route.\n\n- PATCH: False\n  - Not defined for this route.\n\nExplanation:\n- The path is composed by the blueprint prefixes: the CMS blueprint is mounted at /cms in app/__init__.py, and within the CMS blueprint, the user blueprint is mounted at /user. The change_password endpoint is defined as /change_password inside app/api/cms/user.py, so the full path becomes /cms/user/change_password.\n- The endpoint specifies only PUT in the decorator (@user_api.route(\"/change_password\", methods=[\"PUT\"])), so only PUT is accepted according to the code.\n- Flask automatically provides an OPTIONS response for routes with defined methods, so OPTIONS is acceptable.\n- HEAD is not automatically added unless GET is allowed; since GET is not allowed here, HEAD is not acceptable.\n\nIf you need the OpenAPI spec for this endpoint, I can generate a minimal spec snippet reflecting path /cms/user/change_password with method PUT and the associated request/response schemas."
