        "content": "Here is the determined information for the update_user endpoint you described.\n\nResult summary\n- Full HTTP request path: /cms/admin/user/{uid}\n  - Rationale: The update_user route is defined as @admin_api.route(\"/user/<int:uid>\", methods=[\"PUT\"]) inside the admin blueprint. The admin blueprint is registered under /admin in app/api/cms/__init__.py, and the cms blueprint itself is mounted at /cms in app/__init__.py. So the full path with the {uid} parameter is /cms/admin/user/{uid}.\n- All methods acceptable? No\n  - Reason: The route explicitly lists methods=[\"PUT\"], so not all HTTP methods are accepted.\n- HEAD: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: The route does not define HEAD, and Flask does not automatically provide HEAD support for non-GET methods based on the code alone.\n- POST: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in the route’s methods.\n- OPTIONS: Acceptable\n  - Reason: While not explicitly listed, Flask/Werkzeug automatically handles OPTIONS for routes, returning the allowed methods (including PUT). This behavior is framework-level rather than explicit in this endpoint’s decorator.\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined and Flask does not provide TRACE for this route.\n- GET: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in the route’s methods.\n- PUT: Acceptable\n  - Reason: The route is defined with methods=[\"PUT\"].\n- DELETE: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in the route’s methods.\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in the route’s methods.\n\nExplanation\n- Path construction: The endpoint lives under the cms blueprint, which is mounted at /cms, and the admin blueprint under cms is mounted at /admin. The specific route is /user/<int:uid> with PUT. Since the path parameter is still a variable, it becomes /cms/admin/user/{uid} in the final URL.\n- HTTP methods: The methods list in the route decorator determines which HTTP methods Flask will route to this function. Since only PUT is specified, only PUT should be considered acceptable for this endpoint.\n- Special methods (HEAD/OPTIONS): \n  - HEAD is typically provided automatically only for GET routes; since this is a PUT route, HEAD is not automatically enabled by the code.\n  - OPTIONS is generally handled by the framework to advertise allowed methods; although not explicit in code, Flask/Werkzeug will respond to OPTIONS requests with the appropriate response listing allowed methods for this route. This is why OPTIONS can be considered acceptable based on the framework behavior."
