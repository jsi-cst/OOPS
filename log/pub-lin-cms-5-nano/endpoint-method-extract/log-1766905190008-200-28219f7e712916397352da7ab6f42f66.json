Only POST is permitted; HEAD is not automatically enabled since GET is not allowed; OPTIONS is automatically handled by Flask.\n\n2) Path: /cms/user/login\n- Accepted methods (from code): POST\n- All methods accepted: False\n- HEAD: False\n- OPTIONS: True\n- TRACE: False\n- GET: False\n- PUT: False\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n- Explanation: Only POST is allowed for login; same HEAD/OPTIONS behavior as above.\n\n3) Path: /cms/user (update)\n- Accepted methods: PUT\n- All methods accepted: False\n- HEAD: False\n- OPTIONS: True\n- TRACE: False\n- GET: False\n- POST: False\n- PUT: True\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n- Explanation: PUT is the only permitted method for updating user info; HEAD is not enabled because GET isn’t allowed; OPTIONS is provided.\n\n4) Path: /cms/user/change_password\n- Accepted methods: PUT\n- All methods accepted: False\n- HEAD: False\n- OPTIONS: True\n- TRACE: False\n- GET: False\n- POST: False\n- PUT: True\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n- Explanation: PUT is the only permitted method for changing password; same HEAD/OPTIONS behavior as above.\n\n5) Path: /cms/user/information\n- Accepted methods: GET (no methods argument means GET)\n- All methods accepted: False\n- HEAD: True (HEAD is provided automatically when GET is allowed)\n- OPTIONS: True\n- TRACE: False\n- GET: True\n- POST: False\n- PUT: False\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n- Explanation: This endpoint returns user information; GET is allowed, so HEAD is automatically supported by Flask.\n\n6) Path: /cms/user/refresh\n- Accepted methods: GET\n- All methods accepted: False\n- HEAD: True\n- OPTIONS: True\n- TRACE: False\n- GET: True\n- POST: False\n- PUT: False\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n- Explanation: Refreshing tokens uses GET; HEAD is enabled because GET is allowed; OPTIONS is provided.\n\n7) Path: /cms/user/permissions\n- Accepted methods: GET\n- All methods accepted: False\n- HEAD: True\n- OPTIONS: True\n- TRACE: False\n- GET: True\n- POST: False\n- PUT: False\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n- Explanation: Fetching current user permissions uses GET; HEAD is enabled due to GET; OPTIONS is provided.\n\n8) Path: /cms/user/captcha\n- Accepted methods: GET, POST\n- All methods accepted: False\n- HEAD: True (GET is allowed)\n- OPTIONS: True\n- TRACE: False\n- GET: True\n- POST: True\n- PUT: False\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n- Explanation: CAPTCHA can be retrieved or submitted; HEAD is enabled because GET is allowed; OPTIONS is provided.\n\nOverall notes\n- All endpoints live under the CMS/user namespace: /cms/user/...\n- The allowed methods are exactly what the decorators specify. Flask by default provides an automatic OPTIONS response for each route, and HEAD is automatically provided only when GET is allowed for that route.\n- There is no endpoint here with a wildcard “all methods” acceptance; for every endpoint, AllMethodsAccepted is False.\n\nExplanation of results\n- The full paths come from combining the CMS blueprint prefix (/cms) with the user blueprint prefix (/user) and the specific route paths in app/api/cms/user.py.\n- The HTTP methods allowed for each path are taken directly from the @user_api.route(...) decorators.\n- HEAD is deemed acceptable for an endpoint only if GET is also acceptable (per Flask behavior). Since some endpoints allow only non-GET methods (e.g., POST, PUT), their HEAD is False. For endpoints that allow GET (information, refresh, permissions, captcha GET), HEAD is True.\n- OPTIONS is considered acceptable for all endpoints because Flask automatically handles OPTIONS for routes with defined methods.\n- TRACE remains False unless explicitly implemented (not in the provided code).\n\nIf you’d like, I can format this as a machine-readable OpenAPI snippet listing each path with its methods and per-method HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE capabilities."
