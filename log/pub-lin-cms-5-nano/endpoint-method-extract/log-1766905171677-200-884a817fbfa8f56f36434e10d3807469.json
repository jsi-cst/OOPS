        "content": "I can determine only the base path prefix from the provided code; I cannot determine the exact endpoint path or which HTTP methods are allowed without seeing the actual route definitions inside the CMS blueprint.\n\nWhat I can confirm from the given files:\n- The CMS-related endpoint is registered via a Blueprint returned by create_cms(), and this blueprint is mounted with the URL prefix /cms.\n  - In app/__init__.py: app.register_blueprint(create_cms(), url_prefix=\"/cms\")\n  - Therefore, all routes defined inside the CMS blueprint will live under /cms, e.g. /cms/whatever, depending on how the routes are defined inside that blueprint.\n\nWhat I cannot determine from the provided content:\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint (the exact string like /cms/some/path or /cms/admin/create) because the actual route path is defined inside the CMS blueprint (in files such as app/api/cms/__init__.py or similar), which you have not provided.\n- The acceptable HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) for create_cms. The methods depend on the @blueprint.route(...) decorators (and their methods=... argument) inside the CMS blueprint, which are not shown here.\n\nWhat you need to provide to complete the OpenAPI spec request:\n- The contents of the CMS API blueprint where create_cms is defined, typically in a file like app/api/cms/__init__.py (or wherever the blueprint is created and routes are registered). Specifically:\n  - The route path(s) and their methods for the endpoint(s) exposed by create_cms.\n  - Any dynamic path parameters (e.g., <int:id> or <string:slug>) that should be wrapped in curly braces in OpenAPI format.\n- If there are multiple routes under the CMS blueprint for create_cms, provide all of them so I can list each path and its accepted methods.\n\nSummary:\n- Full path prefix: /cms (from app/__init__.py)\n- Full path exact values: Not determinable from the provided files alone; require the CMS blueprint route definitions.\n- Acceptable HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, PATCH): Not determinable from the provided files; require the route decorators inside the CMS blueprint.\n\nIf you share the CMS blueprint file (likely app/api/cms/__init__.py or the file where create_cms is defined) I can:\n- Determine the exact full path(s) (e.g., /cms/admin, /cms/some-resource/{id}, etc.) with path parameters wrapped in curly braces.\n- Indicate, for each path, which HTTP methods are accepted (and if HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE are supported) based on the actual route definitions.\n- Provide a concise explanation of the results."
