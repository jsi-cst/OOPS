I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/api/cms/file.py`, I found that `app.api.cms.create_cms` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

This blueprint is mounted under cms with url_prefix=\"/file\" and that cms blueprint is mounted on the app with url_prefix=\"/cms\". Therefore, the full path is /cms/file. There are no path parameters.\n\n- Acceptable HTTP methods (overall): False\n  - Explanation: The route explicitly defines methods=[\"POST\"]. No other HTTP methods are implemented for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: False\n  - Explanation: Since only POST is defined for this route, HEAD is not explicitly allowed. In Flask/Werkzeug, HEAD is not automatically allowed unless GET (or a suitable method) is present. GET is not defined here, so HEAD should be considered not acceptable based on the code.\n\n- POST: True\n  - Explanation: The route is defined with methods=[\"POST\"] and the function post_file() handles the request.\n\n- OPTIONS: True\n  - Explanation: Flask automatically handles OPTIONS requests for routes, even if not explicitly listed, by returning the allowed methods in the response. Since POST is defined, OPTIONS would be handled accordingly by the framework.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - Explanation: There is no TRACE handling defined in the code for this endpoint, and TRACE is not provided by default.\n\n- GET: False\n  - Explanation: GET is not defined for this route; only POST is.\n\n- PUT: False\n  - Explanation: PUT is not defined for this route.\n\n- DELETE: False\n  - Explanation: DELETE is not defined for this route.\n\n- PATCH: False\n  - Explanation: PATCH is not defined for this route.\n\nExplanation of results\n\n- The OpenAPI-like assessment is based strictly on the implemented route: a POST-only endpoint at /cms/file (as part of the cms/file blueprint, under the /cms prefix). The code shows a single route with methods=[\"POST\"] and a view function post_file(), decorated with authentication and API validation. Therefore, the endpoint supports only POST. HEAD/GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH/TRACE are not implemented by this endpoint; OPTIONS is typically handled by Flask automatically, so it’s considered available.",
