        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /cms/user/refresh\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable? No. The route is defined without an explicit methods list, so Flask defaults to GET. It does not declare all methods as allowed.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? Yes. In Flask, if GET is defined for a route, HEAD is automatically handled by the framework.\n\n- POST acceptable? No. Not declared in the route (methods not including POST).\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? Yes. Flask provides automatic handling for OPTIONS on routes, even if not explicitly declared.\n\n- TRACE acceptable? No. The route does not declare TRACE, and Flask does not enable TRACE by default for this route.\n\n- GET acceptable? Yes. The route defaults to GET, and the function logic corresponds to a GET-style token refresh endpoint.\n\n- PUT acceptable? No. Not declared in the route (PUT not listed).\n\n- DELETE acceptable? No. Not declared in the route (DELETE not listed).\n\n- PATCH acceptable? No. Not declared in the route (PATCH not listed).\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined in app/api/cms/user.py as @user_api.route(\"/refresh\") inside the user blueprint, which itself is mounted at /cms (cms blueprint) and /user (user blueprint). Consequently, the full path becomes /cms/user/refresh.\n- Since the route did not specify a methods list, Flask treats it as GET by default. Flasks also auto-handle HEAD and OPTIONS for routes that support GET, which is why HEAD and OPTIONS are considered acceptable even though not explicitly declared.\n- Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not declared for this route, so they are not acceptable per the code."
