        "content": "Here is the analysis of the endpoints implemented in app/api/cms/log.py, considering how the blueprints are registered and how Flask handles routes.\n\nHow the full paths are formed\n- The log endpoints live under the cms blueprint, which is mounted at /cms, and the log blueprint is mounted at /log within cms.\n- Therefore, the three endpoints are:\n  - /cms/log\n  - /cms/log/search\n  - /cms/log/users\n\nHTTP methods (based on the code)\n- All three routes use @log_api.route(...) with no explicit methods parameter.\n  - In Flask, a route with no methods defaults to GET.\n  - Consequently, the endpoints accept GET requests.\n  - HEAD and OPTIONS are not explicitly defined, but Flask automatically supports HEAD and OPTIONS for routes that have GET. The presence of CORS (via apply_cors) does not restrict these; it mainly affects cross-origin behavior and OPTIONS handling for CORS preflight.\n\nAnswers per endpoint\n\n1) Path: /cms/log\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n- HEAD: True (Flask provides HEAD automatically for GET routes)\n- POST: False\n- OPTIONS: True (Flask provides OPTIONS automatically for GET routes)\n- TRACE: False (not implemented in code)\n- GET: True\n- PUT: False\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n\n2) Path: /cms/log/search\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n- HEAD: True\n- POST: False\n- OPTIONS: True\n- TRACE: False\n- GET: True\n- PUT: False\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n\n3) Path: /cms/log/users\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n- HEAD: True\n- POST: False\n- OPTIONS: True\n- TRACE: False\n- GET: True\n- PUT: False\n- DELETE: False\n- PATCH: False\n\nRationale explanation\n- The routes are registered via log_api.route with no methods specified, which by default makes them GET endpoints.\n- Flask automatically handles HEAD (for GET routes) and OPTIONS (for all routes) responses, unless explicitly overridden. This is why HEAD and OPTIONS are considered acceptable for these endpoints even though they are not explicitly defined in the code.\n- POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, and TRACE are not implemented anywhere in these route definitions, so those methods are not acceptable for these endpoints.\n- There are no path parameters in these routes (no dynamic segments like /{id}), so the paths remain as above without curly-braced parameters.\n\nSummary\n- Endpoints and their accepted methods are as listed above.\n- HEAD and OPTIONS are effectively acceptable due to Flask’s default handling for GET routes.\n- All other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not acceptable for these endpoints."
