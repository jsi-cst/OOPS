The admin blueprint is mounted at /admin under the cms blueprint, and the cms blueprint is mounted at /cms. Therefore the full path becomes /cms/admin/user/{uid}.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: The route explicitly specifies methods=[\"DELETE\"], so not all methods are accepted.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: There is no HEAD handler defined for this route in the code. Based on the code, only DELETE is declared.\n\n- POST acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: Only DELETE is declared for this route.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for this route in the code. Since only DELETE is declared, OPTIONS is not represented as acceptable by the code (even though some frameworks may auto-handle OPTIONS).\n\n- TRACE acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: Not declared in the code for this route.\n\n- GET acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: Not declared in the code for this route (only DELETE is declared).\n\n- PUT acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: Not declared in the code for this route.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: True\n  - Rationale: The route is defined with methods=[\"DELETE\"] and the function delete_user(uid) implements the DELETE behavior.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: Not declared in the code for this route.\n\nExplanation:\n- The path composition comes from the blueprint registrations:\n  - cms blueprint mounted at /cms (app/api/cms/__init__.py)\n  - admin_api blueprint mounted at /admin within cms (same file)\n  - the admin route is /user/<int:uid> within admin_api (app/api/cms/admin.py)\n  - Therefore the final path is /cms/admin/user/{uid}.\n- The only HTTP method explicitly enabled for this endpoint is DELETE, as shown by methods=[\"DELETE\"] on the route decorator. The code does not provide any other method handlers for this endpoint, so other methods are not considered acceptable based on the code alone."
