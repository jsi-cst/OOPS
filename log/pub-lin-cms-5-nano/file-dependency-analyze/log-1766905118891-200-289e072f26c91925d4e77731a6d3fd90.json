        "content": "Here are the files that contain the implementation related to app.api.cms.create_cms (i.e., the CMS API blueprints and their handlers). The key file that defines create_cms is app/api/cms/__init__.py, and the actual request handlers for the /cms endpoints are in the submodules it registers.\n\nFiles containing the handler implementations (relative paths):\n- app/api/cms/__init__.py\n- app/api/cms/admin.py\n- app/api/cms/file.py\n- app/api/cms/log.py\n- app/api/cms/user.py\n- app/api/cms/schema/__init__.py\n- app/api/cms/schema/admin.py\n- app/api/cms/schema/log.py\n\nOptional/related:\n- app/__init__.py (shows how create_cms is used to mount the /cms blueprint)\n\nExplanation and how these relate:\n- app/api/cms/__init__.py: This file defines the create_cms function. It creates a CMS blueprint and imports/registers four sub-blueprints (admin, user, log, file) by calling their respective create-like entry points, then returns the assembled cms blueprint. This is the implementation point that wires the CMS endpoints under the /cms path.\n- app/api/cms/admin.py: Contains the administrative HTTP handlers for CMS-related resources (e.g., permissions, users, groups). These endpoints are registered under the cms blueprint's /admin prefix.\n- app/api/cms/file.py: Contains the file upload/management handler(s) for CMS, registered under the cms blueprint’s /file prefix.\n- app/api/cms/log.py: Contains the logging-related handlers for CMS, registered under the cms blueprint’s /log prefix.\n- app/api/cms/user.py: Contains user-management handlers for CMS (e.g., user retrieval, updates, password changes), registered under the cms blueprint’s /user prefix.\n- app/api/cms/schema/__init__.py, app/api/cms/schema/admin.py, app/api/cms/schema/log.py: These contain the Pydantic/Spectree schemas used by the CMS endpoints (request bodies, responses, and validation structures). They are used by the handlers in the admin, user, log, and file modules to validate and structure API data.\n\nWhy this matters for OpenAPI spec:\n- The OpenAPI spec for the /cms endpoints will be composed from the handlers registered by create_cms, i.e., the endpoints defined in admin.py, user.py, log.py, and file.py, along with their request/response schemas defined in the schema modules.\n- The wiring in app/api/cms/__init__.py shows exactly which sub-blueprints contribute to /cms, and therefore which files you should inspect to extract the operation details (paths, methods, parameters, responses) for the OpenAPI spec.\n\nIn short, to generate the OpenAPI spec for /cms, focus on:\n- The wiring in app/api/cms/__init__.py (defines create_cms and which sub-blueprints are mounted)\n- The actual handler implementations in:\n  - app/api/cms/admin.py\n  - app/api/cms/user.py\n  - app/api/cms/log.py\n  - app/api/cms/file.py\n- The data schemas used by those handlers in:\n  - app/api/cms/schema/__init__.py\n  - app/api/cms/schema/admin.py\n  - app/api/cms/schema/log.py\n\nThese files collectively implement the /cms endpoints and provide the information needed to generate a complete OpenAPI specification for that path."
