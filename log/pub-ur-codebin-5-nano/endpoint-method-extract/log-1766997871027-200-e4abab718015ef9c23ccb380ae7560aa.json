        "content": "Here’s the analysis for the CodePasteController’s postNewCodePasteWith endpoint.\n\n- Full HTTP request path (for the postNewCodePasteWith method)\n  - /api/paste\n\n  Note: This endpoint is defined at the class level with @RequestMapping(\"/api/paste\") and the method uses @PostMapping with no additional path, so the full path for this method is exactly /api/paste. There are other endpoints in the same controller that use path parameters (e.g., /api/paste/{paste_id}) and /api/paste/public, but they are not the target endpoint here.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The endpoint is explicitly mapped only to POST (via @PostMapping). There is no global or catch-all method mapping that makes all methods acceptable for /api/paste.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no HEAD mapping for /api/paste in this controller. In the absence of a GET mapping for the same path (which would typically drive automatic HEAD handling), HEAD is not supported by this code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - Yes. The method is annotated with @PostMapping, so POST /api/paste is supported and implemented.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for /api/paste. Based on the code, OPTIONS is not defined for this path.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. TRACE is not defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no GET mapping for /api/paste (the existing GET mappings are for /api/paste/{paste_id} and /api/paste/public).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no PUT mapping for /api/paste.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no DELETE mapping for /api/paste (only DELETE /api/paste/{paste_id} exists).\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no PATCH mapping for /api/paste.\n\nExplanation:\n- The controller is annotated with @RequestMapping(\"/api/paste\"), which defines a base path for all endpoints in this controller.\n- The postNewCodePasteWith method is annotated with @PostMapping and has no additional path, so it handles POST requests to /api/paste.\n- There are other endpoints in the same controller that use path variables (/{paste_id}) or a different path (\"/public\"), but these do not affect the POST /api/paste endpoint.\n- Since only POST is implemented for /api/paste, all other HTTP methods are not supported by this code for that exact path. Spring would only automatically handle other methods if there were corresponding mappings or global configurations, which are not present here."
