        "content": "Here is the analysis for the signup endpoint implemented in UserAccountController.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/account/signup\n  - This is derived from the class-level @RequestMapping(\"/api/account\") plus the method-level @PostMapping(\"/signup\").\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - The controller defines specific mappings:\n    - GET /api/account/{account_id}\n    - POST /api/account/signup\n  - The signup endpoint only supports POST, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable? No\n  - The signup endpoint does not define a HEAD mapping. In Spring, HEAD is not implicitly enabled for non-GET mappings. Since signup is POST, HEAD is not supported by the code for this endpoint.\n\n- POST method acceptable? Yes\n  - The signup endpoint is explicitly annotated with @PostMapping(\"/signup\"), so POST is supported.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable? No\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this endpoint. Without an explicit handler or a global configuration, OPTIONS is not considered acceptable based on the code.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable? No\n  - There is no explicit TRACE mapping for this endpoint, so not acceptable by the code.\n\n- GET method acceptable? No\n  - The signup endpoint itself is not a GET mapping; only POST is defined for /api/account/signup. GET is not applicable to this endpoint.\n\n- PUT method acceptable? No\n  - Not defined for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable? No\n  - Not defined for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable? No\n  - Not defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The controller is annotated with @RequestMapping(\"/api/account\"), giving the base path /api/account.\n- The signup endpoint is defined as @PostMapping(\"/signup\"), resulting in the full path /api/account/signup and accepting only the POST method.\n- Other HTTP methods are not mapped to this endpoint, so they are not acceptable according to the code. HEAD is not automatically inferred for POST mappings in Spring; unless explicitly mapped, it is not considered acceptable here."
