        "content": "Here is the determination based on CodePasteController.java and its mappings.\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint\n  - /api/paste/{paste_id}\n  - Explanation: The class is annotated with @RequestMapping(\"/api/paste\"), and getCodePasteFromId uses @GetMapping(path = \"/{paste_id}\"), so the full path is /api/paste/{paste_id} with the paste_id path parameter wrapped in curly braces.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Explanation: For the /api/paste/{paste_id} path, the controller explicitly defines GET and DELETE methods. There is no mapping for other methods on this path in this class.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Explanation: Spring MVC automatically supports HEAD requests for endpoints that have a GET mapping on the same path. Since there is a GET mapping for /api/paste/{paste_id}, HEAD requests to this path are handled by the framework even without an explicit HEAD method.\n\n- Is POST acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Explanation: There is a POST mapping, but it is on /api/paste (no path variable). It does not apply to /api/paste/{paste_id}.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Explanation: Spring MVC automatically handles OPTIONS for mapped endpoints, providing the allowed methods for the path. Since /api/paste/{paste_id} has GET and DELETE mappings, OPTIONS will be handled by the framework for this path.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Explanation: There is no TRACE mapping for this path, and based on the code, TRACE is not explicitly supported. (Note: TRACE support can be controlled by server configuration, but there is no code in this controller enabling TRACE.)\n\n- Is GET acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Explanation: Explicitly defined by @GetMapping(path = \"/{paste_id}\") on this path.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Explanation: No PUT mapping exists for /api/paste/{paste_id} in this controller.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Explanation: Explicitly defined by @DeleteMapping(path = \"/{paste_id}\") on this path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Explanation: No PATCH mapping exists for /api/paste/{paste_id} in this controller.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint for fetching a paste by ID is /api/paste/{paste_id} and supports GET and DELETE. HEAD is implicitly supported via the GET mapping, and OPTIONS is handled by Spring. POST, PUT, PATCH are not applicable to this specific path (they are defined for other paths in the controller), and TRACE is not supported by the code."
