        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /api/account/{account_id}\n  - Explanation: The class has @RequestMapping(\"/api/account\"), and the getUserAccountById method is annotated with @GetMapping(\"/{account_id}\"), so the complete path for this endpoint is /api/account/{account_id} with the path parameter account_id.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No.\n  - Explanation: This specific endpoint only has an explicit mapping for GET (and no explicit mappings for HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/PUT/DELETE/PATCH). Therefore not all methods are supported for this path.\n\n- HEAD: Acceptable (based on code behavior of Spring)\n  - Explanation: There is a GET mapping for /api/account/{account_id}. In Spring MVC, HEAD requests are typically handled automatically for endpoints that have a GET mapping, returning headers without a body. The code does not explicitly define a HEAD handler, but the framework behavior for GET endpoints covers HEAD requests.\n\n- POST: Acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @PostMapping for /api/account/{account_id}. The only POST mapping present in this controller is for /signup, which is a different path.\n\n- OPTIONS: Acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no explicit method handling for OPTIONS on /api/account/{account_id}. The code does not define an OPTIONS mapping for this path.\n\n- TRACE: Acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no explicit TRACE mapping for /api/account/{account_id} in the code.\n\n- GET: Acceptable? Yes\n  - Explanation: There is an explicit @GetMapping(\"/{account_id}\"), which handles GET requests to /api/account/{account_id} and returns a UserAccountDTO (unless the account is not found, in which case an exception is thrown).\n\n- PUT: Acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: No PUT mapping is defined for /api/account/{account_id}.\n\n- DELETE: Acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: No DELETE mapping is defined for /api/account/{account_id}.\n\n- PATCH: Acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: No PATCH mapping is defined for /api/account/{account_id}.\n\nSummary explanation:\nThe endpoint /api/account/{account_id} is bound only to GET in this controller, so GET is the supported method. HEAD is typically handled automatically by Spring for GET endpoints, so it is effectively acceptable by framework behavior, but it is not explicitly declared in the code. All other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this specific path in the provided code."
