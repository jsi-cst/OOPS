The `routes/invoices.js` file defines a route that uses the PATCH method for the `/invoices/:id` path, which is handled by the `updateInvoice` controller.\n    *   **All HTTP methods:** No.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `updateInvoice` function in `controllers/invoices.js` is designed to handle updates to an existing invoice. The route is defined in `routes/invoices.js` using the `router.patch('/:id', updateInvoice)` which means that the `updateInvoice` function will handle HTTP PATCH requests. The `index.js` file sets up the base path `/invoices` for all routes defined in `invoiceRoutes`. The `:id` in the route definition indicates that the function expects an `id` parameter in the URL, which is used to identify the invoice to be updated.\n"
