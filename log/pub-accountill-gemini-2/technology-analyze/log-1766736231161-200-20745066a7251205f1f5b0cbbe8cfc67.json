Here's the breakdown:\n\n*   **`index.js`**: This is a strong indicator of a Node.js application, as it's commonly the entry point for the server-side code.\n*   **`package.json` and `package-lock.json`**: These files are essential for Node.js projects, managing dependencies and project metadata.\n*   **`controllers`, `middleware`, `models`, `routes`**: These directory names suggest a common structure for web backend projects, often associated with frameworks like Express.js.\n*   **`Dockerfile` and `Procfile`**: These files are used for containerization and deployment, which are common practices in modern web development, and are often used with Node.js applications.\n\nTo confirm the framework, I'll use the `run_command` tool to check the contents of `package.json`. This will likely reveal the specific framework being used (e.g., Express.js, NestJS).\n\n",
