I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/{clients}/clients/{id}/clients/user` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `routes/clients.js`, `clientRoutes` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/{clients}/clients/{id}/clients/user` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a list of Parameter Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].parameters) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the list of Parameter Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

The relevant part is `router.get('/user', getClientsByUser);`. This means that the route `/user` is handled by the `getClientsByUser` controller function. However, the requested endpoint is `/{clients}/clients/{id}/clients/user`. Based on the provided code, there is no route defined for this specific endpoint. I will assume that the endpoint is constructed by combining the base path `/clients` with the route defined in `routes/clients.js`. Also, I need to extract the parameters from the path. The path `/clients/{id}/clients/user` suggests that there is an `id` parameter.\n\n2.  **Determine Parameter Objects:** Based on the path `/clients/{id}/clients/user`, the following parameters are identified:\n    *   `id`: This is a path parameter, which is part of the URL.\n\nTherefore, the generated result should include one parameter object for the `id` parameter.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"id\",\n    \"in\": \"path\",\n    \"required\": true,\n    \"description\": \"ID of the client\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }\n]\n```"
