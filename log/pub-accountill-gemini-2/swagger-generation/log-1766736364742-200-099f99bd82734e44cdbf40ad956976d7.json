I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/profiles/{idand}/profiles` with method POST, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `routes/profile.js`, `profile` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/profiles/{idand}/profiles` with HTTP method POST.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

A successful POST request to create a resource typically returns a 201 Created status code, along with the newly created resource in the response body. If there are any validation errors, it will return 400 Bad Request.\n3.  **Generate the Response Objects:** Based on these assumptions, I'll create the Response Objects in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nNow, let's generate the Response Objects.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n```json\n{\n  \"201\": {\n    \"description\": \"Profile created successfully\",\n    \"schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"id\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"The ID of the created profile\"\n        },\n        \"name\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"The name of the profile\"\n        },\n        \"email\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"description\": \"The email of the profile\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"400\": {\n    \"description\": \"Bad Request - Invalid input\"\n  }\n}\n```"
