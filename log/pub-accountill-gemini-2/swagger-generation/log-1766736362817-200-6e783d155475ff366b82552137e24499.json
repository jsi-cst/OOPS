I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/{clients}/clients/{id}/clients/user` with method PATCH, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `routes/clients.js`, `clientRoutes` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/{clients}/clients/{id}/clients/user` with HTTP method PATCH.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

However, I can assume a successful update will return a 200 OK or 204 No Content status code. I'll start with a 200 OK and an example response.\n3.  **Generate the OpenAPI response object:** I'll create a dictionary representing the response object in the Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nNow, let's generate the response object.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n```json\n{\n  \"200\": {\n    \"description\": \"Client updated successfully\",\n    \"schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"message\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"example\": \"Client updated\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```"
