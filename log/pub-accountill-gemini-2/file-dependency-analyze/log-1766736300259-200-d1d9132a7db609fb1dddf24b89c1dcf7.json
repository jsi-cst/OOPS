To find the implementation of `getInvoice`, I need to look for the file that exports or defines this function. Since the import statement `import {createInvoice, updateInvoice, deleteInvoice, getInvoice, getInvoicesByUser, getTotalCount } from '../controllers/invoices.js'` suggests that the implementation is likely located in `../controllers/invoices.js`, I will first check this file.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Check `../controllers/invoices.js`:** I will use the `run_command` to check the content of the file.\n\nThe command failed because the file does not exist. I will try to find the file using `find` command.\n\nThe `find` command found the file `controllers/invoices.js`.\n\nNow I know that the implementation of `getInvoice` is likely in `controllers/invoices.js`.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\nThe implementation of the `getInvoice` handler is located in the file `controllers/invoices.js`.\n"
