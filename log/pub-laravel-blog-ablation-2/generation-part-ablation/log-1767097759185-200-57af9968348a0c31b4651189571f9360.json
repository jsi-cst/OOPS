I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/v1/comments/{comment}` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/CommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\CommentController@destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/comments/{comment}` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate an Operation object (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method]) in OpenAPI 3.1.0 format. You need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the Operation Object in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above."

          "content": "Explanation:\n\n- The DELETE /v1/comments/{comment} endpoint is implemented by App\\Http\\Controllers\\Api\\V1\\CommentController@destroy.\n- The controller method signature destroy(Comment $comment) indicates route-model binding for a path parameter named comment, which commonly represents the comment's ID.\n- The method calls $this->authorize('delete', $comment) so an unauthorized attempt will result in an authorization failure (403 Forbidden).\n- If the comment is found and authorization passes, the controller deletes the model and returns response()->noContent(), which maps to HTTP 204 No Content on success.\n- If the bound model is not found, the framework will return 404 Not Found.\n- Based on the above, the operation includes a required path parameter \"comment\" (integer), a 204 success response, and common error responses for authorization (403) and not found (404). I used a \"Comments\" tag and operationId \"deleteComment\" to identify the operation.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Remove the specified resource from storage.\",\n  \"operationId\": \"deleteComment\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"Comments\"\n  ],\n  \"parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"comment\",\n      \"in\": \"path\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"ID of the comment\",\n      \"schema\": {\n        \"type\": \"integer\",\n        \"format\": \"int64\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"responses\": {\n    \"204\": {\n      \"description\": \"No Content.
