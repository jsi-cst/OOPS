I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/posts/{post}/likes` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\PostLikeController::destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate an Operation object (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method]) in OpenAPI 3.1.0 format. You need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the Operation Object in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above."

          "content": "Explanation of reasoning and steps:\n\n- I inspected app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php. The controller has two methods, store and destroy, but the task indicates that the route /posts/{post}/likes with HTTP method DELETE is served. The destroy method calls $post->dislike() and returns a MultiplePendingTurboStreamResponse; the store method calls $post->like() but the task states both are implemented to process DELETE — the destroy implementation is the logical handler for removing a like.\n- The controller returns response()->turboStream(...). Turbo Stream responses use the media type text/vnd.turbo-stream.html and consist of HTML fragments containing one or more <turbo-stream> elements. The return type in the method signature is MultiplePendingTurboStreamResponse, confirming a Turbo Stream response is returned (with content).\n- The endpoint has a path parameter {post}, which is a Post route-model-binding key (commonly an ID or slug). The path parameter is required.\n- No request body is used by the controller; the method operates based on the path parameter and the authenticated user (authentication is not visible in the provided file, so security is not declared here).\n- The response is a successful 200 response with Turbo Stream content (not 204), because the controller returns view and update turbo-stream elements.\n\nBased on the above, I constructed an OpenAPI 3.1 Operation Object for DELETE /posts/{post}/likes with:\n- summary and description explaining behavior,\n- operationId pointing to the controller destroy method,\n- a single required path parameter \"post\" (type string to allow numeric IDs or UUIDs),\n- a 200 response with content type text/vnd.turbo-stream.html and a string schema representing the returned Turbo Stream HTML fragment.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Remove a like from a Post\",\n  \"description\": \"Removes an existing like for the specified Post (calls Post::dislike()) and returns Turbo Stream updates for the like button and the likes count. The response is a Turbo Stream HTML fragment (text/vnd.turbo-stream.html) containing one or more <turbo-stream> elements.\",\n  \"operationId\": \"PostLikeController.destroy\",\n  \"parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"post\",\n      \"in\": \"path\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"ID or route-model-binding key of the Post to remove the like from.\",\n      \"schema\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"responses\": {\n    \"200\": {\n      \"description\": \"Turbo Stream response with updated like button and likes count.\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"text/vnd.turbo-stream.html\": {\n          \"schema\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Turbo Stream HTML fragment (one or more <turbo-stream> elements).\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}",
