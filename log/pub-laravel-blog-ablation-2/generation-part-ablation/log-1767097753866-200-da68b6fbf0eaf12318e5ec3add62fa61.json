I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/posts/{post}` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php`, `App\\Http\\Controllers\\PostController::show` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate an Operation object (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method]) in OpenAPI 3.1.0 format. You need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the Operation Object in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above."

          "content": "Explanation of how the Operation was derived:\n\n- Controller and method: app/Http/Controllers/PostController::show handles GET /posts/{post}.\n- Input: the method signature show(Request $request, Post $post) uses Laravel route-model binding for the {post} path parameter; the route parameter therefore represents a Post identifier (commonly numeric ID or slug). Because the code type-hints a Post model, the parameter is required.\n- Behavior: the method computes two derived properties on the model ($post->comments_count and $post->likes_count) by counting related comments and likes, then returns the Blade view posts.show with the post passed into the view.\n- Response: the controller returns a View, which corresponds to an HTML response (text/html). No JSON or API response structure is present in the code, so the response body is modeled as an HTML string.\n- Errors: the controller relies on Laravel route model binding; if the model is not found the framework would return a 404, but the controller code itself only returns the successful view. To keep the Operation object strictly aligned with the controller code, the explicit response modeled here is the successful 200 HTML response.\n- Fields included: only those directly implied by the controller method have been included: summary/description/operationId, one path parameter \"post\" (required), and a 200 response with content text/html and a string schema.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Display the specified Post\",\n  \"description\": \"Returns the Blade view 'posts.show' for a given Post. The controller sets comments_count and likes_count on the Post model before rendering.\",\n  \"operationId\": \"PostController.show\",\n  \"parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"post\",\n      \"in\": \"path\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"description\": \"Route-bound Post identifier (ID or slug) resolved via Laravel route model binding.\",\n      \"schema\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"example\": \"1\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"responses\": {\n    \"200\": {\n      \"description\": \"OK - HTML view of the post\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"text/html\": {\n          \"schema\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"html\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}",
