I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with method POST, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostLikeController@store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method POST.\n\n2. In `app/Concern/Likeable.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostLikeController@store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method POST.\n\n3. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\PostLikeController@destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method POST.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate an Operation object (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method]) in OpenAPI 3.1.0 format. You need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the Operation Object in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above."

The like() method creates and returns a Like model via the morphMany()->create(...) call only if a like by the current authenticated user does not already exist; otherwise it returns nothing (null).\n- Deductions for the OpenAPI operation:\n  - A path parameter \"post\" is required (route model binding supplies a Post model); a numeric identifier is the reasonable default for such a route, so the parameter schema is integer.\n  - Successful creation returns the created Like resource (created by create()), so I model a 201 response with application/json and a generic object schema (fields not specified in the provided code).\n  - If the resource was already liked by the current user, the method returns no value; model this as 204 No Content.\n  - I do not add fields that cannot be inferred from the provided files (no detailed Like schema, no explicit auth scheme declaration in these files), keeping the Operation object minimal and aligned with the code.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"summary\": \"Create a like for a post\",\n  \"operationId\": \"PostLikeController_store\",\n  \"parameters\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"post\",\n      \"in\": \"path\",\n      \"required\": true,\n      \"schema\": {\n        \"type\": \"integer\"\n      },\n      \"description\": \"Identifier of the post to like (route model binding)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"responses\": {\n    \"201\": {\n      \"description\": \"Like created\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"application/json\": {\n          \"schema\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"description\": \"Created Like resource (schema not specified in provided code)\"\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"204\": {\n      \"description\": \"No content — the post was already liked by the current user\"\n    }\n  }\n}",
