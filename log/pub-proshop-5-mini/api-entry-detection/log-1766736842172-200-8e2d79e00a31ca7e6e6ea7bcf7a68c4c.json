I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

Files that contain REST endpoint definitions are typically located under routes/, controllers/, or app.js/server.js and register route handlers with an Express Router or app. While it could hypothetically export a function that uses request/response objects, it’s far more likely to only export token-generation logic and therefore not contain API endpoint definitions.\"}",
