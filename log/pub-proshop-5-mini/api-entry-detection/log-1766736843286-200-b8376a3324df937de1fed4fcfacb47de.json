I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

Files under a utils directory typically export helper functions (pure computation) used by controllers/routes, not define app.get/app.post handlers or an express.Router. While any JS file could technically register endpoints, it is very unlikely here given the name and location; therefore this file is not expected to contain REST API endpoint definitions.\"}",
