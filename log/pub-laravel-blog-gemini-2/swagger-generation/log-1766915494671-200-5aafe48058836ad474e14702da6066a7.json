I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/admin/comments` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\CommentController::store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/admin/comments` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

The `destroy` method is responsible for deleting a comment, and it corresponds to the DELETE method for the `/admin/comments/{comment}` endpoint.\n\n2.  **Analyze the `destroy` method:**\n    *   It receives a `Comment $comment` parameter, which is likely a model instance representing the comment to be deleted. This suggests that the endpoint expects a parameter, probably the comment's ID, in the URL.\n    *   It calls `$comment->delete()`, which removes the comment from the database.\n    *   It redirects to the `admin.comments.index` route with a success message.\n\n3.  **Determine the response:** The method returns a `RedirectResponse`. The successful deletion is indicated by a redirect with a success message. Therefore, a 302 Found or 303 See Other status code is expected.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will generate the response objects for the DELETE `/admin/comments/{comment}` endpoint.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n```json\n{\n  \"302\": {\n    \"description\": \"Comment deleted successfully.
