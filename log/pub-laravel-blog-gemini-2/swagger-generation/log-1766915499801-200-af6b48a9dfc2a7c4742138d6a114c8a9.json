I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/v1/users/{user}/comments` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/UserCommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\UserCommentController::index` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/v1/users/{user}/comments` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

It uses the `CommentResource` to format the response and paginates the results. The `limit` parameter is used for pagination.\n2.  **Determine the response structure:** The response will be a collection of `CommentResource` objects. I need to determine the structure of the `CommentResource`. I will use the `run_command` to get the content of `app/Http/Resources/Comment.php` to understand the structure of the response.\n3.  **Generate the OpenAPI specification:** Based on the code analysis and the structure of `CommentResource`, I will generate the `responses` section for the GET endpoint.\n\nNow, let's execute the command to get the content of `app/Http/Resources/Comment.php`.\n\n",
