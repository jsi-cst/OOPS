I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/api/v1/users/{user}/posts` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/UserPostController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Api\\\\V1\\\\UserPostController::index` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/api/v1/users/{user}/posts` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

It uses the `PostResource` to format the response and paginates the results. The `limit` parameter is used for pagination.\n2.  **Determine the response structure:** Based on the code, the response will be a collection of `PostResource` objects. I'll need to determine the structure of the `PostResource` to define the schema. Since the code uses pagination, the response will likely include pagination metadata (e.g., `current_page`, `per_page`, `total`).\n3.  **Generate the OpenAPI specification:** I will create a dictionary representing the response objects in the Swagger 2.0 format. This will include the HTTP status code (likely 200 for success) and the schema for the response body.\n\nNow, I will execute a command to get more information about the `PostResource` to determine the response schema.\n\n",
