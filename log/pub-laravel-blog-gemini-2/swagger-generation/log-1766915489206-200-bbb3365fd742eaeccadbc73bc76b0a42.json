I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/admin/comments/{comment}` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\Admin\\\\CommentController::class` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/admin/comments/{comment}` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

The `destroy` method is responsible for deleting a comment. Based on the code, the `destroy` method receives a `Comment` model instance as a parameter. It calls the `delete()` method on the model and then redirects to the comments index page with a success message.\n\nHere's how I'll construct the response objects:\n\n*   **200 OK:**  Since the deletion is successful, a 200 OK response is appropriate. The response body might not be necessary, but it's good practice to include a schema, even if it's just an empty one, or a message indicating success.\n*   **404 Not Found:** If the comment with the given ID is not found, a 404 Not Found response should be returned.\n\nNow, I will generate the JSON output.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n```json\n{\n  \"200\": {\n    \"description\": \"Comment deleted successfully\",\n    \"schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"message\": {\n          \"type\": \"string\",\n          \"example\": \"Comment deleted successfully\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"404\": {\n    \"description\": \"Comment not found\"\n  }\n}\n```"
