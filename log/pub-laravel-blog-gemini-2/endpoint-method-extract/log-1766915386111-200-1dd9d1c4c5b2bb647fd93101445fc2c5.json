I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php`, I found that `App\\Http\\Controllers\\PostController@show` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

The line `Route::resource('posts', PostController::class)->only('show');` registers a resource route for the `PostController`. The `->only('show')` part restricts the registered routes to only the `show` method.\n\nThe `show` method in `PostController` is associated with the route. Resource routes, by default, define the following routes:\n\n- `GET /posts/{post}`:  To display a specific post.\n- `PUT /posts/{post}`: To update a specific post.\n- `DELETE /posts/{post}`: To delete a specific post.\n- `PATCH /posts/{post}`: To partially update a specific post.\n- `HEAD /posts/{post}`: To get the headers of a specific post.\n- `OPTIONS /posts/{post}`: To get the allowed methods of a specific post.\n\nSince only `show` is specified, only the `GET` method is enabled. The path parameter `{post}` is derived from the resource name 'posts' and the route model binding.\n"
