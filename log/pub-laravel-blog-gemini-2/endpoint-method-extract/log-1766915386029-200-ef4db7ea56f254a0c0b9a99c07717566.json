I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostCommentController.php`, I found that `App\\Http\\Controllers\\PostCommentController@index` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

The line `Route::resource('posts.comments', PostCommentController::class)->only('index');` defines a nested resource route.  This means that the `PostCommentController` is responsible for handling requests related to comments *of a specific post*. The `only('index')` part restricts the controller to only handle the `index` action.\n\nThe `index` method in `PostCommentController` is associated with the `index` action of the resource.  Resource routes, by default, map HTTP methods to controller actions.  In this case, the `index` action is mapped to the GET method.\n\nThe route definition `Route::resource('posts.comments', PostCommentController::class)` creates routes with the following structure:\n\n-   `GET /posts/{post}/comments` (index)\n\nTherefore, the full path is `/posts/{post}/comments`, where `{post}` is a route parameter representing the post's identifier. Only the GET method is explicitly defined in the `only()` method.\n"
