The line `Route::apiResource('posts', PostController::class)->only(['index', 'show']);` is relevant. This line creates RESTful routes for the `PostController`. The `only(['index', 'show'])` part restricts the generated routes to only the `index` and `show` methods of the controller.\n2.  **Path Prefix and Resource:** The `apiResource` method automatically creates routes based on the resource name ('posts' in this case) and the controller class. The `prefix('v1')` in `routes/api.php` adds the `/v1` prefix to all routes within that group. Therefore, the base path for the `Post` resource is `/v1/posts`.\n3.  **`show` Method and Path Parameter:** The `show` method in `PostController` is designed to display a specific post.  The `apiResource` method automatically creates a route with a path parameter for the `show` method. The parameter is named after the resource, so it's `{post}`.  This means the full path is `/v1/posts/{post}`.\n4.  **HTTP Methods:**\n    *   The `apiResource` method, combined with the `only(['index', 'show'])` call, explicitly defines which HTTP methods are supported.\n    *   The `show` method is associated with the GET method.\n    *   The `index` method is associated with the GET method.\n    *   The `update` method is associated with the PUT and PATCH methods.\n    *   The `store` method is associated with the POST method.\n    *   The `destroy` method is associated with the DELETE method.\n    *   The `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `TRACE` methods are not explicitly defined in the routes, and therefore are not acceptable.\n    *   The `PUT`, `POST`, and `DELETE` methods are not acceptable because they are not included in the `only` array.\n    *   The `PATCH` method is not acceptable because it is not included in the `only` array.\n"
