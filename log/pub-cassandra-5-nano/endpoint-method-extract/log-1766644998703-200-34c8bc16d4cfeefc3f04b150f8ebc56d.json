        "content": "- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint: /api/v0/ops/node/snapshots\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No. The endpoint clearSnapshots is mapped only to DELETE, via @DELETE and @Path(\"/snapshots\").\n\n- Is the HEAD method acceptable? No. There is no HEAD handler for this endpoint in the code (only DELETE is defined for /snapshots in this class).\n\n- Is the POST method acceptable? No for this specific endpoint. Although there is another POST mapping for /snapshots (takeSnapshot) in the same path, the clearSnapshots endpoint itself is defined only for DELETE.\n\n- Is the OPTIONS method acceptable? No. There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this endpoint; behavior would depend on the server, but based on code alone, not acceptable.\n\n- Is the TRACE method acceptable? No. Not defined in code for this endpoint.\n\n- Is the GET method acceptable? No. The GET mapping for /snapshots is a different operation (getSnapshotDetails); for clearSnapshots, GET is not defined.\n\n- Is the PUT method acceptable? No. Not defined for this endpoint.\n\n- Is the DELETE method acceptable? Yes. The clearSnapshots endpoint is annotated with @DELETE.\n\n- Is the PATCH method acceptable? No. Not defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The class NodeOpsResources is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/node\"). The clearSnapshots method is annotated with @DELETE and @Path(\"/snapshots\"), which results in the full path /api/v0/ops/node/snapshots for this operation.\n- ClearSnapshots is designed to clear snapshots and takes query parameters, but only supports the DELETE HTTP method. Although there exists a POST handler for /snapshots (takeSnapshot) elsewhere in the same class, that is a different operation under the same path and does not make DELETE applicable to GET/POST/etc. for this endpoint. Therefore, only DELETE is acceptable for clearSnapshots, and all other HTTP methods are not."
