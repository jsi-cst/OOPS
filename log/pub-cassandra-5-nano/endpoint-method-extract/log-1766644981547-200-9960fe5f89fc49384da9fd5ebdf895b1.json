There are no handlers for other methods, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no @HEAD method defined for this endpoint, and no generic HEAD handling is implemented in the code shown.\n\n- POST acceptable: true\n  - Reasoning: The method is annotated with @POST, so POST is explicitly supported.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this endpoint, and no code in the snippet provides an automatic OPTIONS handler.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: No TRACE handler is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: No @GET method is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: No @PUT method is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: No @DELETE method is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: No @PATCH method is defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint reloadLocalSchema is declared as @POST and mapped to /schema/reload under the base path /api/v0/ops/node. Therefore, the full path is /api/v0/ops/node/schema/reload, and only the POST method is supported by the code. There are no explicit handlers in the code for HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, or OPTIONS, so they are not considered acceptable based on the code. HEAD/OPTIONS behavior can sometimes be provided by the web framework, but since the code does not define handlers for them, they are not treated as acceptable endpoints here."
