There are no path parameters in this endpoint.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: The endpoint defines only a POST method for /compact. No other HTTP verbs are implemented for this specific path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: There is no @HEAD method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- POST acceptable: true\n  - Explanation: The method scrub/compact is defined with @POST and handles the request for /compact, so POST is supported.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path. While some containers may auto-handle OPTIONS, the code itself does not provide an explicit handler.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: There is no TRACE handling method defined for this path.\n\n- GET acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: The /compact endpoint has only a POST method defined; there is no @GET method for this path.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: There is no @PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: There is no @DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: There is no @PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint for compaction is defined solely as a POST operation at /api/v0/ops/tables/compact. No other HTTP methods or path variants are implemented for this specific endpoint in the provided code, so only POST is acceptable. The lack of explicit handlers for HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, and TRACE means those methods are not supported by this code for /api/v0/ops/tables/compact."
