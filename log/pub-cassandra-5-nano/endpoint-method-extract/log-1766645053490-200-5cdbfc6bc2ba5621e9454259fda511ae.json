There are no path parameters in this endpoint (only a query parameter keyspaceName).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No.\n  - The endpoint defines only one HTTP method: GET (via @GET on getReplication). No other methods are implemented for this path.\n\n- Is the HEAD method acceptable? No (based on code).\n  - There is no method annotated with @HEAD, and the codebase for this endpoint does not provide an explicit HEAD handler. Therefore HEAD is not defined by the code for this path.\n\n- Is the POST method acceptable? No.\n  - There is no @POST mapping on /api/v0/ops/keyspace/replication; only GET is defined for this path.\n\n- Is the OPTIONS method acceptable? No.\n  - There is no @OPTIONS mapping for this endpoint.\n\n- Is the TRACE method acceptable? No.\n  - There is no @TRACE mapping for this endpoint.\n\n- Is the GET method acceptable? Yes.\n  - The method getReplication is annotated with @GET and handles the request to /api/v0/ops/keyspace/replication, returning the replication settings for a keyspace (requires a non-blank keyspaceName query parameter).\n\n- Is the PUT method acceptable? No.\n  - There is no @PUT mapping for this endpoint.\n\n- Is the DELETE method acceptable? No.\n  - There is no @DELETE mapping for this endpoint.\n\n- Is the PATCH method acceptable? No.\n  - There is no @PATCH mapping for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined at class level with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/keyspace\") and at method level with @Path(\"/replication\"), plus an explicit @GET on getReplication. Therefore, only GET requests to /api/v0/ops/keyspace/replication are supported. The endpoint uses a query parameter keyspaceName, and if keyspaceName is blank, it returns a 400; if the keyspace exists, it returns the replication settings as JSON, otherwise a 404. Since there is no explicit handling for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH on this path in the code, those methods are not considered acceptable per the code."
