        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/probes/cluster\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No. The code defines only a GET handler for this path.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No. There is no method annotated with HEAD for this path; GET is defined, but HEAD is not implemented in the code for this endpoint.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No. There is no POST handler for this path.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No. There is no OPTIONS handler for this path.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No. There is no TRACE handler for this path.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? Yes. The method checkClusterConsistency is annotated with @GET for this path.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No. There is no PUT handler for this path.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No. There is no DELETE handler for this path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No. There is no PATCH handler for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The class K8OperatorResources is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0\"), and the checkClusterConsistency method has @Path(\"/probes/cluster\") and @GET, which combines to the full endpoint path /api/v0/probes/cluster. The method only handles GET requests; there are no other HTTP method annotations for this same path in the provided code. Therefore, only GET is acceptable for this endpoint, and none of the other methods (HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are implemented for this path in the code."
