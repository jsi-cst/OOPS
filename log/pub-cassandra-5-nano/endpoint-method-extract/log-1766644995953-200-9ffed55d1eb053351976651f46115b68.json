There is no support in code for all methods.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - There is no @HEAD method for this endpoint, and the code does not imply HEAD handling.\n\n- POST acceptable: true\n  - The method stopNode is annotated with @POST, making POST the supported method for /api/v0/lifecycle/stop.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - There is no @OPTIONS method, and the analysis is based strictly on explicit annotations in code.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - There is no @TRACE method, so TRACE is not defined by the code.\n\n- GET acceptable: false\n  - There is no @GET method for this path; the only mapping is POST.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - There is no @PUT method for this path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - There is no @DELETE method for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - There is no @PATCH method for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined by the class-level path /api/v0/lifecycle and the method-level path /stop with a POST annotation. Therefore, the only HTTP method explicitly supported by this code for /api/v0/lifecycle/stop is POST.\n- Other HTTP methods (HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not defined for this endpoint in the source, so they are not considered acceptable based on the code alone. (Note: Some frameworks may automatically support OPTIONS or HEAD, but this analysis sticks to what is explicitly coded.)"
