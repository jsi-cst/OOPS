        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/node/decommission\n\n  - Rationale: The class NodeOpsResources has a class-level path @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/node\"), and the decommission method is annotated with @POST and @Path(\"/decommission\"). Therefore the full path is /api/v0/ops/node/decommission. There are no path parameters in this endpoint (only a query parameter force).\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n\n  - Rationale: This endpoint is defined with a single HTTP method annotation: @POST. There are no other method-specific handlers for this path in the provided code, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: false\n\n  - Rationale: There is no method annotated with @HEAD, and HEAD is not implied from a POST-only endpoint in this code. Therefore HEAD is not explicitly supported by this endpoint.\n\n- POST: true\n\n  - Rationale: The decommission endpoint is explicitly annotated with @POST, so POST is supported.\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit @OPTIONS method, but JAX-RS (RESTEasy) typically responds to OPTIONS requests for resource methods, enumerating the allowed methods (in this case, POST for this path). Since there is at least one HTTP method defined for this resource, OPTIONS is effectively supported by the framework even though not explicitly coded.\n\n- TRACE: false\n\n  - Rationale: There is no @TRACE method defined for this path, and TRACE is not implied by the code.\n\n- GET: false\n\n  - Rationale: There is no @GET method defined for this path, and the decommission operation is implemented as POST only.\n\n- PUT: false\n\n  - Rationale: There is no @PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE: false\n\n  - Rationale: There is no @DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH: false\n\n  - Rationale: There is no @PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nExplanation\n\n- The endpoint lives under the class-level path /api/v0/ops/node and uses a method-level path /decommission with HTTP method POST, so the full URL is /api/v0/ops/node/decommission and it accepts a query parameter force. Only POST is implemented for this specific path, hence not all methods are acceptable. HEAD is not implemented for this endpoint. OPTIONS is typically handled by the REST framework automatically to report allowed methods (here effectively POST); GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH/TRACE are not implemented for this path in the provided code."
