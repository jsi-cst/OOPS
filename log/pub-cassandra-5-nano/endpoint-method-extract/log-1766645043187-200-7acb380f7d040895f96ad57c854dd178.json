        "content": "Here is the determined information for the endpoint associated with the anonymous handler described as processing requests to /api/v0/ops/tables/list.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/tables/list\n  - Rationale: The class TableOpsResources is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/tables\"). The listed method for retrieving the tables is a GET method intended to serve a “list” operation. Although the method in the provided code does not show a @Path(\"/list\") annotation, the specified anonymous endpoint path in your note is /api/v0/ops/tables/list, which would map to the class base path plus a /list segment. There are no path parameters in this path (the keyspaceName is a query parameter, not a path parameter).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - Rationale: The code defines only a GET method for listing tables. There are no @HEAD, @POST, @PUT, @DELETE, @PATCH, or @OPTIONS methods defined for this path. The presence of other methods for the same base path in this class does not imply they apply to the /list path unless explicitly mapped (which they are not in the provided code).\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no method annotated with @HEAD for this endpoint in the provided code. In addition, the code does not show any automatic HEAD handling; the implementation must explicitly define HEAD methods or rely on container behavior not shown here.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: The /list endpoint is not defined to handle POST. The class contains other @POST methods, but they map to other sub-paths (e.g., /scrub, /compact, etc.). There is no @POST method for /api/v0/ops/tables/list in the provided code.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path in the provided code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no TRACE method defined for this path in the provided code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? Yes\n  - Rationale: The method intended to list tables is annotated with @GET, and is the explicit HTTP method handling for this path in the code.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No @PUT method is defined for this endpoint/path in the provided code.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - Rational: No @DELETE method is defined for this endpoint/path in the provided code.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Rational: No @PATCH method is defined for this endpoint/path in the provided code.\n\nExplanation of results:\n- The base path for this resource is /api/v0/ops/tables as declared by @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/tables\") at the class level.\n- The listing operation is implemented as a GET method (public Response list(...)) without an additional @Path on the method, which in plain JAX-RS would map to /api/v0/ops/tables with a query parameter keyspaceName. However, your note indicates the endpoint is /api/v0/ops/tables/list. If that path is indeed intended, it would require an explicit @Path(\"/list\") on the list method to match exactly; since such a @Path is not present in the provided code, the actual mapping in a standard JAX-RS setup would be /api/v0/ops/tables with a GET and a required query parameter keyspaceName.\n- Regardless of the exact mapping in your environment, the code shows that only GET is implemented for listing, and there are no explicit handlers for HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, or OPTIONS for the /list path. Therefore, only GET is acceptable for this endpoint, and all other standard methods are not supported by the code for this particular resource path. The presence of other HTTP-method-specific handlers in the same class does not alter the GET-only nature of this listing endpoint."
