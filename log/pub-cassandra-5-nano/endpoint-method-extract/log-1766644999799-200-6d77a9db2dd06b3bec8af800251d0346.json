        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint implemented in LifecycleResources.configureNodeJson (and the related configure methods):\n\n- Full HTTP request path\n  - /api/v0/lifecycle/configure\n\n  Explanation: The class has @Path(\"/api/v0/lifecycle\") and the two configure methods are annotated with @Path(\"/configure\"), resulting in the full path /api/v0/lifecycle/configure. There are two POST handlers (one consuming JSON and one consuming YAML), both mapped to this same path.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n  Explanation: The endpoint only defines HTTP POST handlers (two methods, one for JSON and one for YAML). There are no GET/PUT/DELETE/HEAD/OPTIONS/etc. handlers for this path.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n  Explanation: There is no @HEAD method defined for /api/v0/lifecycle/configure. Only POST methods exist for this path.\n\n- POST method acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n\n  Explanation: Both configureNodeJson and configureNode are annotated with @POST and mapped to /api/v0/lifecycle/configure, so POST is explicitly supported.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n  Explanation: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n  Explanation: There is no @TRACE method defined for this path.\n\n- GET method acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n  Explanation: There is no @GET method defined for /api/v0/lifecycle/configure (GET is only defined for /api/v0/lifecycle/pid).\n\n- PUT method acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n  Explanation: There is no @PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n  Explanation: There is no @DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n  Explanation: There is no @PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nSummary explanation:\n- The endpoint /api/v0/lifecycle/configure is configured to accept only POST requests (with two variants: one consuming JSON and one consuming YAML). No other HTTP methods are implemented for this path, and no HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH methods are provided, per the code in LifecycleResources.java. The two POST methods are also marked as @Hidden for OpenAPI generation, but they still map to the same path and HTTP method."
