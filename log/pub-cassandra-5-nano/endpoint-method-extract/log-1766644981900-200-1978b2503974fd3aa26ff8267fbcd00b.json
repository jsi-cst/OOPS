        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint that maps to setLoggingLevel in NodeOpsResources.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/node/logging\n  - This endpoint is defined with class-level path @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/node\") and method-level path @Path(\"/logging\") on a POST method. There are no path parameters in this endpoint, so the full path is exactly /api/v0/ops/node/logging.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - The endpoint defines only a single HTTP method: POST. There is no support for other HTTP methods on /api/v0/ops/node/logging in this code.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No\n  - There is no HEAD method defined for this path; only POST is defined.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? Yes\n  - The method is annotated with @POST and @Path(\"/logging\"), so POST is explicitly supported.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - There is no explicit @OPTIONS handler for this path. Therefore, OPTIONS is not defined in this code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE handler defined for this path.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No\n  - There is no GET handler defined for this path.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No\n  - There is no PUT handler defined for this path.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - There is no DELETE handler defined for this path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - There is no PATCH handler defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The only relevant endpoint is the POST method at /api/v0/ops/node/logging (setLoggingLevel). The class and method annotations show POST being used for this operation, with no other HTTP method annotations for the same path. Consequently, only POST is acceptable for this endpoint; all other HTTP methods are not supported by this code. HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH are not defined for this path in NodeOpsResources."
