        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint implemented in K8OperatorResources.checkReadiness.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/probes/readiness\n  - Rationale: The class is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0\") and the method with @Path(\"/probes/readiness\"), and the method uses @GET. The full path is the combination of class-level path and method-level path. There are no path parameters in this endpoint, so no curly brace substitutions are needed.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: The endpoint method is annotated only with @GET. There are no annotations for other HTTP methods (e.g., @POST, @PUT, @DELETE, etc.), so not all methods are supported by this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit method annotated with @HEAD, and the code does not provide a separate HEAD handler. Based strictly on the code, HEAD is not declared as an allowed method for this endpoint.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no @POST method for /api/v0/probes/readiness. The only method for this path is a GET handler.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this endpoint, and the code does not show any handling for OPTIONS. Therefore, OPTIONS is not declared as acceptable by the code.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: No TRACE handler or support is declared for this endpoint in the code.\n\n- GET acceptable: true\n  - Rationale: The method is annotated with @GET and @Path(\"/probes/readiness\"), so GET is explicitly supported.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no @PUT method for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no @DELETE method for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no @PATCH method for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint is defined as GET /api/v0/probes/readiness (no path parameters).\n- Only GET is explicitly supported by the code.\n- Other HTTP methods (HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not declared for this path in the code, so they are not considered acceptable based on the code alone. Note that some frameworks may implicitly support HEAD/OPTIONS, but since you asked to decide strictly from the code, they are marked as not acceptable here."
