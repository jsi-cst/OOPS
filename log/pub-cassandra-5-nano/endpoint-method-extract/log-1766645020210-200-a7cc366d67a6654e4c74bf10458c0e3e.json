        "content": "Here is the analysis focused on the list endpoint implemented in TableOpsResources.list, which processes requests to the path /api/v0/ops/tables.\n\n- Full HTTP request path\n  - /api/v0/ops/tables\n  - This endpoint does not have any path parameters (no {param} in the path). It takes a query parameter keyspaceName instead.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The code defines only the GET method for this specific path. Other HTTP methods are not implemented for /api/v0/ops/tables (without a subpath).\n\n- HEAD\n  - Not acceptable. There is no method annotated with @HEAD for this path in the code. GET is implemented, but HEAD is not explicitly defined.\n\n- POST\n  - Not acceptable for this path. The POST methods exist for subpaths like /scrub, /compact, /flush, etc., but not for the base path /api/v0/ops/tables itself.\n\n- OPTIONS\n  - Not acceptable. No OPTIONS handler is defined for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE\n  - Not acceptable. No TRACE handler is defined.\n\n- GET\n  - Acceptable. The list endpoint is explicitly annotated with @GET and returns the list of tables for a provided keyspaceName.\n\n- PUT\n  - Not acceptable. No PUT handler is defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE\n  - Not acceptable. No DELETE handler is defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH\n  - Not acceptable. No PATCH handler is defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The class is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/tables\"). The list method has @GET and no additional @Path, so the full path for the list operation is exactly /api/v0/ops/tables. It expects a query parameter keyspaceName.\n- The codebase includes several other POST endpoints under /api/v0/ops/tables (e.g., /scrub, /compact, /flush, /create, etc.), but they pertain to different subpaths and do not affect the list endpoint’s supported methods.\n- There is no @HEAD method defined for the list endpoint, so HEAD is not explicitly supported by the code (even though some servers may map HEAD to GET, this is not specified by code here).\n- Therefore, the only acceptable HTTP method for the /api/v0/ops/tables endpoint (as implemented by list) is GET; all other HTTP methods are not implemented for this specific path."
