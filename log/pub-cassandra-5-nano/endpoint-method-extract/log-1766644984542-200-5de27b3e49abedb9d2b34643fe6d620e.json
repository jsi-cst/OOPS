        "content": "Here are the determinations based on the provided code in K8OperatorResources.java.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/seeds/reload\n  - Reasoning: The class has @Path(\"/api/v0\"), and the method seedReload() has @POST and @Path(\"/ops/seeds/reload\"), giving the full path /api/v0/ops/seeds/reload. There are no path parameters in this endpoint, so no curly-braced parameters are present.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? false\n  - Reasoning: Only the POST method is implemented for this path. There are no definitions for other HTTP methods in this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no @HEAD method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- POST: true\n  - Reasoning: The seedReload() method is annotated with @POST, and implements the logic for this endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no @TRACE method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- GET: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no @GET method defined for this path in the code (other GET methods exist in the class, but not for this endpoint).\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no @PUT method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no @DELETE method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no @PATCH method defined for this path in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint /api/v0/ops/seeds/reload is implemented exclusively as a POST operation (seedReload) in K8OperatorResources. Since there are no other HTTP method annotations or handlers for this path, only POST is supported, and all other standard methods are not implemented for this endpoint. If the server auto-handles OPTIONS/HEAD, that behavior would be at the container level and is not dictated by the code provided."
