There are no other HTTP verb handlers defined for this path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: No\n  - Reason: There is no @HEAD method defined for this path (only a @POST method exists).\n\n- POST acceptable: Yes\n  - Reason: The method upgradeSSTables is annotated with @POST and @Path(\"/sstables/upgrade\"), making POST the supported method for this endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: No\n  - Reason: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path, and the code does not provide an explicit handler for OPTIONS.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: No\n  - Reason: There is no @TRACE method defined for this path.\n\n- GET acceptable: No\n  - Reason: There is no @GET method defined for this path.\n\n- PUT acceptable: No\n  - Reason: There is no @PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: No\n  - Reason: There is no @DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: No\n  - Reason: There is no @PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is declared at class level with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/tables\"), and the specific method in question uses @POST and @Path(\"/sstables/upgrade\"). Therefore, the full path is /api/v0/ops/tables/sstables/upgrade and the only HTTP method implemented for this endpoint is POST. The code does not provide handlers for HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, or TRACE, so those methods are not supported for this endpoint based on the code."
