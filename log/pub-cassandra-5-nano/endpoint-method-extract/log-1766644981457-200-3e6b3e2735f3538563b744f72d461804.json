        "content": "Here is the analysis for the resetLocalSchema endpoint in NodeOpsResources.java.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/node/schema/reset\n  - Reasoning: The class is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/node\"), and the method resetLocalSchema() is annotated with @POST and @Path(\"/schema/reset\"), giving the combined path /api/v0/ops/node/schema/reset. There are no path parameters to wrap in {}.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: The endpoint defines only a POST method. There is no support in the code for other HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) on this path.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: There is no @HEAD method defined for this path. Without an explicit HEAD handler, HEAD is not considered acceptable based on the code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? Yes\n  - Reasoning: The method is annotated with @POST, so POST is implemented and acceptable.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path in the code. OPTIONS handling would be provided by the framework/defaults, but not as an explicit endpoint in this code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: No TRACE method is defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: There is no @GET method for this path; only POST is defined.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: There is no @PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: There is no @DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: There is no @PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint is a POST-only operation at /api/v0/ops/node/schema/reset.\n- The code defines only POST and does not provide handlers for other HTTP methods, nor for HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH on this path. Therefore, only POST is acceptable per the code. Any other method would not be handled by this endpoint according to the source."
