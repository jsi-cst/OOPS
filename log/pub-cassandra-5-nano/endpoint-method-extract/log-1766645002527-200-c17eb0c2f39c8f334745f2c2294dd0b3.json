No. The endpoint defines only GET.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable (based on code, not assumptions)? No. There is no @HEAD method defined for this path; only a GET method is present.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No. No POST method is defined for this path.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No. No explicit OPTIONS handler is defined for this path.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No. No TRACE handler is defined for this path.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? Yes. The method getPID is annotated with @GET for /api/v0/lifecycle/pid.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No. No PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No. No DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No. No PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The class LifecycleResources is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/lifecycle\"). The getPID method is annotated with @Path(\"/pid\") and @GET, so the full endpoint path is /api/v0/lifecycle/pid and it only supports the GET method.\n- There are no other methods in this class that handle /api/v0/lifecycle/pid with other HTTP verbs, and there is no explicit @HEAD, @OPTIONS, @TRACE, @PUT, @DELETE, or @PATCH method for this path. Therefore, only GET is supported for this endpoint according to the code."
