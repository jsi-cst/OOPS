        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/keyspace/create\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this path? No. Only POST is implemented for this specific path.\n\n- Is the HEAD method acceptable? No. There is no @HEAD method defined for this path (and no GET-based fallback on this path is defined in the code).\n\n- Is the POST method acceptable? Yes. The create method is annotated with @POST and mapped to /create.\n\n- Is the OPTIONS method acceptable? No. There is no @OPTIONS handler for this path in the code.\n\n- Is the TRACE method acceptable? No. There is no TRACE handler for this path.\n\n- Is the GET method acceptable? No. The /create path does not have a GET handler; the only method defined for this path is POST.\n\n- Is the PUT method acceptable? No. Not defined for this path.\n\n- Is the DELETE method acceptable? No. Not defined for this path.\n\n- Is the PATCH method acceptable? No. Not defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined by the class-level path @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/keyspace\") and the method-level path @Path(\"/create\") with the HTTP method annotation @POST on the create(...) method. Therefore, the full path is /api/v0/ops/keyspace/create and the allowed HTTP method for this specific path is POST only.\n- There are no @HEAD, @GET, @PUT, @DELETE, @PATCH, @OPTIONS, or @TRACE annotations for this path in the code, so other HTTP methods are not supported by this endpoint as implemented. HEAD/OPTIONS behavior in some frameworks may be provided automatically, but per the instruction “based on the code, not on experiential assumptions,” they are not considered acceptable here."
