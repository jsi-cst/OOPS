There are no path parameters in this endpoint.\n\nHTTP methods assessment (based strictly on the code)\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: No\n  - Reason: Only a POST method is implemented for this path (see @POST on the compact method). No other methods are defined for this path.\n\n- HEAD: No\n  - Reason: There is no method annotated for HEAD for this path. The code does not indicate any HEAD handling; HEAD is not implicitly defined by the presence of a POST method.\n\n- POST: Yes\n  - Reason: The compact method is annotated with @POST, and it processes the request accordingly.\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Reason: There is no OPTIONS method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reason: There is no TRACE method defined for this path.\n\n- GET: No\n  - Reason: The only method for /api/v0/ops/tables/compact is POST. The class also contains a GET method for /api/v0/ops/tables (without /compact), which is a different endpoint.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - Reason: No PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Reason: No DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reason: No PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nExplanation summary\n- The endpoint /api/v0/ops/tables/compact is explicitly implemented only with a POST method (compact). There are no annotations or methods for HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, or TRACE on this path in the provided code. Therefore, per code inspection, only POST is acceptable for this endpoint; all other HTTP methods are not supported for this specific path."
