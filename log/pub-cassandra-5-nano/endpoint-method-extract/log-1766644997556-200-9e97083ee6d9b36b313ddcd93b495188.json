No. There are only two methods implemented for this path: GET and POST.\n\n- Is the HEAD method acceptable? No. There is no method annotated with @HEAD for this path.\n\n- Is the POST method acceptable? Yes. There is a method setFullQuerylog annotated with @POST at /fullquerylogging.\n\n- Is the OPTIONS method acceptable? No. There is no method annotated with @OPTIONS for this path (and we’re judging based on the code, not framework-default behavior).\n\n- Is the TRACE method acceptable? No. There is no method annotated with @TRACE for this path.\n\n- Is the GET method acceptable? Yes. There is a method isFullQueryLogEnabled annotated with @GET at /fullquerylogging.\n\n- Is the PUT method acceptable? No. There is no method annotated with @PUT for this path.\n\n- Is the DELETE method acceptable? No. There is no method annotated with @DELETE for this path.\n\n- Is the PATCH method acceptable? No. There is no method annotated with @PATCH for this path.\n\nExplanation:\nThe endpoint is defined under the class path /api/v0/ops/node. The specific /fullquerylogging path has two handlers: POST (setFullQuerylog) and GET (isFullQueryLogEnabled). No @HEAD, @OPTIONS, @TRACE, @PUT, @DELETE, or @PATCH methods are present for this path, so those methods are not supported by the code. In REST frameworks, OPTIONS handling can sometimes be automatic, but since we must base the verdict on the code, it is considered not acceptable here."
