        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/tables/scrub\n  - Reason: The method is annotated with @POST and @Path(\"/scrub\") inside a class annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/tables\"), so the full path is /api/v0/ops/tables/scrub. There are no path parameters in this endpoint, so no {} are needed.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Reason: The code defines specific methods for various endpoints (e.g., multiple @POST methods and a @GET method). There is no generic “all methods” mapping at this path.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - Reason: There is no method annotated with @HEAD in this class. The code only provides explicit methods for POST and GET (and others are not present), so HEAD is not supported by code.\n\n- POST: true\n  - Reason: There are explicit @POST methods for this path (scrub) and additional POST endpoints under /api/v0/ops/tables (e.g., /scrub, /sstables/upgrade, /compact, /garbagecollect, /flush, /create).\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Reason: No @OPTIONS method is defined for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Reason: No @TRACE method is defined for this path.\n\n- GET: true\n  - Reason: There is a @GET method defined for listing tables at /api/v0/ops/tables (the list endpoint).\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Reason: No @PUT method for this path.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Reason: No @DELETE method for this path.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Reason: No @PATCH method for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question is the scrub operation under /api/v0/ops/tables, implemented as a POST method at /scrub within the TableOpsResources class, which itself is under the base path /api/v0/ops/tables. Therefore, the full path is /api/v0/ops/tables/scrub.\n- The codebase here defines several specific HTTP methods (mostly POST and one GET) but does not define handlers for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH for this path. Therefore those methods are not supported by the code for this endpoint. The “all methods” case is also not applicable since there is no single handler that accepts every HTTP method for this path."
