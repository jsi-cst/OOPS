There are no path parameters to wrap in curly braces for this endpoint.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - The endpoint is annotated only with @GET, and there are no other method annotations or overrides that would allow other HTTP methods.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - There is no @HEAD method defined for this endpoint in the code. While some servers may implement HEAD automatically for a GET method, the code does not explicitly provide or override a HEAD method, so based strictly on the code, HEAD is not explicitly supported.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - No @POST method is defined for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - No explicit @OPTIONS method is defined for this path.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - No explicit @TRACE method is defined for this path.\n\n- GET acceptable: true\n  - The method is annotated with @GET for path \"/versions/release\", and this is the implemented operation.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - No @PUT method is defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - No @DELETE method is defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - No @PATCH method is defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined at class path \"/api/v0/metadata\" and method path \"/versions/release\" with a single HTTP method annotated: GET. Therefore, only GET is explicitly supported by the code for this endpoint.\n- There are no explicit HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH methods for this path in the source, so they are not considered acceptable based on the code.\n- If the REST framework automatically handles HEAD for GET requests, that would be an implementation detail outside the explicit code annotations; however, strictly from the code, HEAD is not implemented."
