        "content": "Here is the analysis for the TableOpsResources.garbageCollect endpoint.\n\n- Full HTTP request path (starts with / and uses {} for path parameters when present)\n  - /api/v0/ops/tables/garbagecollect\n  - There are no path parameters in this endpoint (no variables in the path itself). The tombstoneOption value is supplied as a query parameter, not a path parameter.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable?\n  - No. The endpoint is defined only with @POST, so not all HTTP methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD\n  - Not acceptable based on the code. There is no @HEAD method defined for this path, and the endpoint does not provide a way to respond to HEAD requests beyond what is defined by the POST handler.\n\n- POST\n  - Acceptable. The method is explicitly annotated with @POST and handles the request.\n\n- OPTIONS\n  - Not acceptable based on the code. There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path, and behavior for OPTIONS is not implemented in this code.\n\n- TRACE\n  - Not acceptable based on the code. No @TRACE method is defined.\n\n- GET\n  - Not acceptable based on the code. No @GET method is defined for this path.\n\n- PUT\n  - Not acceptable based on the code. No @PUT method is defined.\n\n- DELETE\n  - Not acceptable based on the code. No @DELETE method is defined.\n\n- PATCH\n  - Not acceptable based on the code. No @PATCH method is defined.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint lives in a class annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/tables\"), and the specific method uses @POST @Path(\"/garbagecollect\"), making the full path /api/v0/ops/tables/garbagecollect.\n- The method is strictly a POST handler and uses a @QueryParam tombstoneOption along with a KeyspaceRequest body. There are no other HTTP method handlers (@GET, @PUT, @DELETE, etc.) for this path, and no @HEAD/@OPTIONS/@TRACE/@PATCH methods are defined. Therefore only POST is supported by the code."
