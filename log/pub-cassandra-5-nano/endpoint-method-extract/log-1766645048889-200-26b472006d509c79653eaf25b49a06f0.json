        "content": "Here is the analysis for the scrub endpoint in com.datastax.mgmtapi.resources.v1.TableOpsResources:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v1/ops/tables/scrub\n  - Reasoning: Class-level path is @Path(\"/api/v1/ops/tables\") and the method scrub is annotated with @POST and @Path(\"/scrub\"), so the full path is the combination: /api/v1/ops/tables + /scrub = /api/v1/ops/tables/scrub. There are no path parameters in this endpoint.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - Reasoning: The endpoint is explicitly annotated with POST only. There are no annotations for other HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.), so only POST is supported.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: No HEAD method is implemented or mapped for this endpoint.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? Yes\n  - Reasoning: The scrub endpoint is annotated with @POST and implements the behavior for POST requests.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: There is no @OPTIONS mapping; OPTIONS would rely on framework default behavior, but not defined in code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: No TRACE mapping present.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: No GET mapping present; only POST is defined.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: No PUT mapping present.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: No DELETE mapping present.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Reasoning: No PATCH mapping present.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined at class level with @Path(\"/api/v1/ops/tables\") and the scrub method handles POST requests at @Path(\"/scrub\"). This yields the single supported HTTP method: POST for the path /api/v1/ops/tables/scrub. The method consumes JSON and produces plain text, returning an accepted job ID, but there is no handling for any other HTTP methods, so only POST is acceptable per the implemented code. HEAD/GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH/TRACE/OPTIONS are not implemented for this endpoint."
