There are no path parameters in this endpoint (no {param} in the path).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? false\n  - The endpoint is annotated only with @POST, so only POST is defined for this path.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? false\n  - There is no HEAD method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? true\n  - The truncateHints method is annotated with @POST, making POST the only defined method for this path.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? false\n  - There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? false\n  - There is no TRACE method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? false\n  - There is no GET method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? false\n  - There is no PUT method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? false\n  - There is no DELETE method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? false\n  - There is no PATCH method defined for this path in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is mapped at class level to /api/v0/ops/node and the specific method truncateHints is mapped to POST /hints/truncate, yielding /api/v0/ops/node/hints/truncate.\n- The code provides exactly one HTTP method for this path: POST. There are no other methods declared for this path, so all other methods (HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not defined as acceptable by the code.\n- Therefore, only POST is acceptable for this endpoint, according to the implemented annotations."
