        "content": "Full HTTP request path\n- /api/v1/ops/tables/compact\n  - Rationale: Class-level @Path(\"/api/v1/ops/tables\") combined with method-level @Path(\"/compact\") yields /api/v1/ops/tables/compact. There are no path parameters in curly braces.\n\nHTTP methods analysis (based strictly on code)\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Reason: The endpoint is explicitly defined with @POST only. No other HTTP method annotations are present for this path.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - Reason: There is no method annotated with @HEAD (or otherwise mapping HEAD to this path). Based on code, HEAD is not defined as acceptable.\n\n- POST: true\n  - Reason: The method compact is annotated with @POST, consumes JSON, and produces text/plain. This is the supported method for /compact.\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Reason: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path in the code. Without explicit mapping, OPTIONS is not considered acceptable by the code.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Reason: No @TRACE mapping is defined.\n\n- GET: false\n  - Reason: There is no @GET method defined for this path.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Reason: There is no @PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Reason: There is no @DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Reason: There is no @PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint is declared under /api/v1/ops/tables with a single operation at /compact that handles POST requests to perform a table compaction (as indicated by @POST and method name compact). The code does not provide any other HTTP-method mappings (no HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, etc.), nor any explicit OPTIONS/TRACE handlers. Therefore, only POST is acceptable, and all other methods (including HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not supported by the code for this endpoint."
