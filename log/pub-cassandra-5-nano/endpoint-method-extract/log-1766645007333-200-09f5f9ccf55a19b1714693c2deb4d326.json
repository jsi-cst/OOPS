There are no path parameters in this endpoint.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: The endpoint is annotated with @POST only, so only the POST method is supported. No support for other HTTP methods is declared.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @HEAD method defined for this path. Without an explicit HEAD handler, HEAD is not provided by code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? Yes\n  - Explanation: The scrub method is annotated with @POST and implements the endpoint logic, so POST is the supported method for this path.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path. The code does not declare an OPTIONS handler, so it is not explicitly supported by code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @TRACE method defined for this path.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: The scrub endpoint is POST-only; there is no @GET method for this path.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nSummary: The scrub endpoint is strictly POST /api/v0/ops/tables/scrub, consuming JSON and producing plain text, with no support for any other HTTP methods according to the code."
