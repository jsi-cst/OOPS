        "content": "Here is the analysis for the setFullQuerylog endpoint in src/main/java/com/datastax/mgmtapi/resources/NodeOpsResources.java.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/node/fullquerylogging\n\n  Explanation: The class is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/node\"). The setFullQuerylog method has @POST and @Path(\"/fullquerylogging\"), so the complete path is the combination: /api/v0/ops/node + /fullquerylogging = /api/v0/ops/node/fullquerylogging.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n\n  Explanation: Only POST is defined for this specific path (setFullQuerylog). There is also a separate GET mapping for the same sub-path (isFullQueryLogEnabled), but that is a different method (GET) on the same path, not “all methods.” Therefore not all HTTP methods are acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (based on code)\n\n  Explanation: There is no method annotated with @HEAD for this path, and no explicit HEAD handling shown. While some containers may map HEAD to GET by convention, the code does not specify HEAD, so per code this is not considered acceptable.\n\n- POST: Acceptable\n\n  Explanation: The method setFullQuerylog is annotated with @POST and implements the operation.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable\n\n  Explanation: There is no method annotated with @OPTIONS for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n\n  Explanation: There is no method annotated with @TRACE for this path.\n\n- GET: Acceptable\n\n  Explanation: There is a GET method isFullQueryLogEnabled mapped to the same path /fullquerylogging, so GET is explicitly supported (even though on a different function).\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable\n\n  Explanation: No @PUT method for this path.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable\n\n  Explanation: No @DELETE method for this path (the DELETE for /snapshots exists, but not for /fullquerylogging).\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n\n  Explanation: No @PATCH method for this path.\n\nOverall summary:\n- Path: /api/v0/ops/node/fullquerylogging\n- All methods: No\n- HEAD: No\n- POST: Yes\n- OPTIONS: No\n- TRACE: No\n- GET: Yes\n- PUT: No\n- DELETE: No\n- PATCH: No\n\nExplanation: The endpoint has a POST implementation (setFullQuerylog) and there is a separate GET implementation for the same sub-path (isFullQueryLogEnabled). No explicit handling for other HTTP methods is present in the code, so only GET and POST are supported according to the source."
