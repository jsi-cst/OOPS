        "content": "- Full HTTP request path (must start with / and use {param} for path params if any):\n  - /api/v0/metadata/localdc\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The resource defines only a method annotated with @GET for the path /api/v0/metadata/localdc. No other HTTP methods are implemented for this path.\n\n- HEAD: acceptable?\n  - No. There is no method annotated with @HEAD, and the code does not provide an explicit automatic HEAD mapping. Based strictly on the code, HEAD is not supported for this endpoint.\n\n- POST: acceptable?\n  - No. There is no POST method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- OPTIONS: acceptable?\n  - No. There is no OPTIONS method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: acceptable?\n  - No. There is no TRACE method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- GET: acceptable?\n  - Yes. The method getLocalDataCenter is annotated with @GET and @Path(\"/localdc\"), and the class has a base @Path(\"/api/v0/metadata\"), so GET is the supported HTTP method for this endpoint.\n\n- PUT: acceptable?\n  - No. There is no PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE: acceptable?\n  - No. There is no DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH: acceptable?\n  - No. There is no PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined in MetadataResources with class-level @Path(\"/api/v0/metadata\") and method-level @Path(\"/localdc\") on a method annotated with @GET. This yields the full path /api/v0/metadata/localdc and indicates that only the GET method is implemented for this resource.\n- No methods annotated with HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, or TRACE are present for this path, so those methods are not supported by the code for this endpoint. The assessment is based strictly on the code, not on general REST conventions."
