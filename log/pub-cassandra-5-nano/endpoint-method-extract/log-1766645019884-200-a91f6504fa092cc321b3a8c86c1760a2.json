        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint implemented in TableOpsResources.java that handles the creation of a table.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/tables/create\n  - Reason: The class has @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/tables\"), and the method for creation is annotated with @POST and @Path(\"/create\"). There are no path parameters for this endpoint, so the full path is exactly /api/v0/ops/tables/create.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Reason: Only POST is implemented for this specific path. There are no methods declared for HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, or TRACE on /api/v0/ops/tables/create.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (false)\n  - Reason: There is no @HEAD method for this path in the code. HEAD is not explicitly implemented.\n\n- POST: Acceptable (true)\n  - Reason: The method create(...) is annotated with @POST and @Path(\"/create\"), consuming JSON and producing plain text.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable (false)\n  - Reason: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable (false)\n  - Reason: There is no @TRACE method defined for this path.\n\n- GET: Not acceptable (false)\n  - Reason: The only defined handler for this specific path is POST. There is a separate GET handler for /api/v0/ops/tables (listing tables) but not for /api/v0/ops/tables/create.\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable (false)\n  - Reason: No PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable (false)\n  - Reason: No DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable (false)\n  - Reason: No PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint in question is explicitly defined only with a POST method at /api/v0/ops/tables/create, consuming JSON and producing text/plain. There are no other HTTP method handlers on this exact path, so only POST is supported per the code. Other methods are not implemented for this path, although other endpoints in the same resource class may use different paths and have their own supported methods."
