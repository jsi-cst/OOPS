        "content": "Here is what the code defines for the endpoint in AuthResources.java:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/auth/role/\n  - Rationale: The class is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/auth\"), and the createRole method is annotated with @POST and @Path(\"/role/\"). Combining them gives /api/v0/ops/auth + /role/ = /api/v0/ops/auth/role/. Path parameters would be shown as {param}, but there are none in this endpoint.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: The endpoint defines only one HTTP method via @POST. There are no methods annotated for other HTTP verbs, so only POST is implemented for this path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @HEAD or any handling that would respond to HEAD requests in code. In general, HEAD is not guaranteed unless a GET one exists; here, only POST is implemented, so HEAD is not acceptable based on the code.\n\n- POST acceptable? Yes\n  - Explanation: The method createRole is annotated with @POST, so POST is explicitly supported.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @OPTIONS method or explicit handling in code. Therefore, OPTIONS is not implemented by this code.\n\n- TRACE acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no TRACE method handling in code, so TRACE is not supported by this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @GET method defined for this path.\n\n- PUT acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @PUT method defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @DELETE method defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: There is no @PATCH method defined for this path.\n\nSummary: The endpoint at /api/v0/ops/auth/role/ only supports POST (as implemented). All other HTTP methods (HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not implemented in code for this path."
