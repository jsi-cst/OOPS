        "content": "Here are the requested details for the NodeOpsResources.compaction endpoint:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v0/ops/node/compaction\n  - Explanation: The class is annotated with @Path(\"/api/v0/ops/node\"), and the compaction method has @Path(\"/compaction\"). Therefore the full path is /api/v0/ops/node/compaction. There are no path parameters in this endpoint, so no curly-braced parameters are present.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: The endpoint is defined only with the POST method (@POST on /compaction). There are no annotations indicating support for all HTTP methods.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: There is no @HEAD method defined for this path in the code. In absence of a handler, HEAD is not declared acceptable by the code.\n\n- POST acceptable: True\n  - Explanation: The method is annotated with @POST and mapped to /compaction, so POST is supported.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: There is no @OPTIONS method defined for this path.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: There is no @TRACE method defined for this path.\n\n- GET acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: There is no @GET method for /compaction (a GET method exists for other paths like /streaminfo and /snapshots, but not for /compaction).\n\n- PUT acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: No @PUT method is defined for /compaction.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: No @DELETE method is defined for /compaction.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: No @PATCH method is defined for /compaction.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The only HTTP method implemented for /api/v0/ops/node/compaction is POST, as shown by the @POST annotation on the method handling /compaction within the NodeOpsResources class. No other HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are declared for this specific path in the code, so they are not considered acceptable based on the source."
