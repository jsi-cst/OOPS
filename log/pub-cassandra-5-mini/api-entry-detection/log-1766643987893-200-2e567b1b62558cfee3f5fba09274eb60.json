I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

The package name 'resources' and the class name ending with 'Resources' strongly indicate a JAX-RS resource class that exposes REST endpoints (e.g., node operations like drain/decommission). In a RESTEasy/Netty Java project such classes typically contain @Path and HTTP method annotations (@GET, @POST, etc.), so it is likely this file contains API endpoint definitions. Without viewing the file contents I cannot be 100% certain, but the location and naming make it very likely.\"}",
