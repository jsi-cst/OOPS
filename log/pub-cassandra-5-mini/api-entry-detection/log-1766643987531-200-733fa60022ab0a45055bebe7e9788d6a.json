I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

In a JAX‑RS/RESTEasy project such files typically contain @Path and HTTP method annotations (e.g., @GET, @POST) to expose API endpoints. Given the project context (management API, K8Operator) it is very likely this file defines REST API endpoints rather than being solely configuration or tests.\"}",
