        "content": "- Full HTTP request path:\n  /printshops/{printShopID}/employees\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable (override)? \n  No\n\n- Per-method acceptance (based on the source code annotations, not runtime behavior):\n  - HEAD: No\n  - POST: Yes\n  - OPTIONS: No\n  - TRACE: No\n  - GET: Yes\n  - PUT: Yes\n  - DELETE: No\n  - PATCH: No\n\nExplanation:\n- The ManagerController class has no class-level @RequestMapping, so the method-level mappings are full paths as written.\n- The getEmployees method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees\", method = RequestMethod.GET), so GET is supported for that path.\n- The same path (/printshops/{printShopID}/employees) is also used by two other methods in this class:\n  - addEmployee annotated with method = RequestMethod.POST — therefore POST is supported for that path.\n  - editEmployee annotated with method = RequestMethod.PUT — therefore PUT is supported for that path.\n- There are no mappings in this class for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, DELETE, or PATCH on the path /printshops/{printShopID}/employees. (There is a DELETE mapping, but it is for the different path /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}.)  \n- The answers above follow only the explicit @RequestMapping(method=...) annotations present in the source, per your instruction to base decisions on the code rather than runtime framework behavior."
