The decision is based only on explicit @RequestMapping entries.)\n\n- POST: true\n  (There is an explicit @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees\", method = RequestMethod.POST).)\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  (No explicit mapping for OPTIONS in the code.)\n\n- TRACE: false\n  (No explicit mapping for TRACE in the code.)\n\n- GET: true\n  (There is an explicit @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees\", method = RequestMethod.GET).)\n\n- PUT: true\n  (There is an explicit @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees\", method = RequestMethod.PUT).)\n\n- DELETE: false\n  (There is a DELETE mapping in this controller, but its path is /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID} — that does not match /printshops/{printShopID}/employees exactly.)\n\n- PATCH: false\n  (No explicit mapping for PATCH in the code.)\n\nExplanation:\nThe ManagerController class has no class-level @RequestMapping, so the endpoint paths are exactly the method-level values. The code contains three explicit mappings for the path \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees\": one each for RequestMethod.GET, RequestMethod.POST and RequestMethod.PUT — therefore GET, POST and PUT are accepted for this exact path. Other HTTP methods are not present in any matching @RequestMapping for this path; the DELETE mapping exists but requires an additional path segment ({employeeID}), so DELETE does not apply to the exact path /printshops/{printShopID}/employees. The determination above is based only on the explicit annotations in the source code."
