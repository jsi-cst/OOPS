There is a DELETE mapping in the controller, but it targets /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID} (i.e. requires an {employeeID} path parameter), not /printshops/{printShopID}/employees.\n\n- PATCH acceptable?\n  No (no explicit mapping for PATCH in the code)\n\nExplanation:\n- The controller methods show explicit @RequestMapping annotations:\n  - GET -> @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\n  - POST -> @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees\", method = RequestMethod.POST)  (this is the addEmployee method you asked about)\n  - PUT -> @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees\", method = RequestMethod.PUT)\n  - DELETE -> @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}\", method = RequestMethod.DELETE) (note the extra {employeeID} path segment)\n- No class-level @RequestMapping is present in this controller, so the full path is exactly as specified on the method-level annotations.\n- I only considered explicit mappings in the source (per your instruction). Although some frameworks may implicitly support HEAD for GET or provide default OPTIONS handling, those are not represented as explicit method mappings in this code and therefore were marked as not acceptable."
