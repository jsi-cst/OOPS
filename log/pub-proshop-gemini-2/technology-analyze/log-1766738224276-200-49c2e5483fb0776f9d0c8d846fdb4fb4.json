Based on the file names, here's my analysis:\n\n*   **JavaScript:** The presence of `seeder.js` and `server.js` strongly suggests that the project is written in JavaScript.\n*   **Framework:** The directory structure (controllers, models, routes, middleware) is highly indicative of a Node.js framework, most likely **Express.js**. This structure is a common pattern for Express applications.\n\nTo confirm this, I'll use the `default_api.run_command` to check the `package.json` file, which often contains information about the project's dependencies and framework.\n\nOkay, it seems like there is no `package.json` file in the current directory. I will try to find it using the `find` command.\nIt seems like there is no `package.json` file in the project. However, based on the file structure, the project is most likely using **JavaScript** and the **Express.js** framework.\n"
