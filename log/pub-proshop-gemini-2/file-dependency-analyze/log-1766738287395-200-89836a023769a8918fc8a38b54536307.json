Therefore, the file containing the implementation of the product routes is likely located at `routes/productRoutes.js`.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Import:** The line `import productRoutes from './routes/productRoutes.js';` indicates that the `productRoutes` variable is populated by the content of the file `routes/productRoutes.js`.\n2.  **Usage:** The line `app.use('/api/products', productRoutes);` uses the `productRoutes` to handle requests to the `/api/products` path.\n\nTherefore, the file `routes/productRoutes.js` should contain the implementation of the handlers for the `/api/products` routes.\n\nThe file `routes/productRoutes.js` exists.\n\nHere's the final answer:\n\n*   `routes/productRoutes.js`\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe `server.js` file imports `productRoutes` from the file `routes/productRoutes.js` and uses it to handle requests to the `/api/products` path. This indicates that the implementation of the product routes is located in `routes/productRoutes.js`.\n"
