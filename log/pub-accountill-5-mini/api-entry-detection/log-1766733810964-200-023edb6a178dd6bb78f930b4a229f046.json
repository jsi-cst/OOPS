I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

Middleware files typically implement functions with the (req, res, next) signature rather than registering Express routes or HTTP handlers. While any file can technically also register routes, it would be uncommon for an auth middleware module to define API endpoints; a quick inspection of its contents would confirm, but based on path and name alone it is very unlikely to contain REST endpoint definitions.\"}",
