I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

It typically does not define HTTP handlers or route registrations used by Gin. While any Go file can technically contain handler code, it is uncommon for doc.go to hold REST endpoint definitions — these are usually in router, controller, or handler source files. Therefore it is very unlikely this file contains API endpoint definitions.\"}",
