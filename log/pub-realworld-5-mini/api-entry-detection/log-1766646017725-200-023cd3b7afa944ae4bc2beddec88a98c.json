I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

In Go/Gin projects REST endpoints are usually registered on a router or implemented as handler functions referencing gin.Context (or calling router.GET/POST/etc.), typically located in main, routes, handlers/controllers packages. A database.go file normally imports database drivers/ORMs and provides connection/migration helpers. Only if this file imported github.com/gin-gonic/gin or declared functions with signatures using *gin.Context or performed router.Handle/router.GET calls would it contain endpoints — without those indicators it is very unlikely to define REST API endpoints.\"}",
