I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

In Spring Boot projects, REST API endpoints are typically defined in classes under a controllers package and often named with a Controller suffix. While the class name CoversTable does not explicitly reveal it as a controller (and could be a domain/DTO class), the location makes it plausible that the file can contain REST endpoint mappings.
