        "content": "Here is the analysis based on ConsumerController.java for the addUser endpoint.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /consumer/register\n  - Rationale: The method addUser is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/register\", method = RequestMethod.POST). There is no class-level prefix shown in this file, so the full path is simply /consumer/register.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: The mapping specifies method = RequestMethod.POST, so only POST is mapped for this path.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit HEAD mapping for this endpoint, and the only declared mapping is POST. Spring MVC does not automatically treat POST mappings as HEAD-compatible signals for this endpoint.\n\n- POST method acceptable? Yes\n  - Rationale: The endpoint is explicitly mapped with method = RequestMethod.POST, and addUser handles registration logic.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable? Yes\n  - Rationale: In Spring MVC, when a path is mapped with a specific method (POST in this case), the framework typically responds to OPTIONS with the allowed methods for that path. So OPTIONS is acceptable.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no TRACE mapping for this path, and there’s no code enabling TRACE handling.\n\n- GET method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no GET mapping for /consumer/register in this controller.\n\n- PUT method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No PUT mapping for this path.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No DELETE mapping for this path.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined solely by a single @RequestMapping on /consumer/register with POST, so only POST is supported at this path.\n- HEAD is not supported because there is no HEAD (or equivalent GET fallback) mapping.\n- OPTIONS is generally supported automatically by Spring for the mapped path, reflecting the allowed methods (here, POST).\n- All other HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not supported for this path as there are no corresponding mappings in the code."
