        "content": "Here is the endpoint information derived from PrintShopController#getPrintShopRequest and related mappings:\n\n- Full HTTP request path:\n  - /printshops/requests/{id}\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable?\n  - No. This endpoint is defined with method = RequestMethod.GET, so only GET is explicitly supported by the code. Other methods are not defined for this path in the controller.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable?\n  - Yes, in Spring MVC, a GET mapping typically supports HEAD requests automatically as a framework behavior (no explicit HEAD method is declared, but HEAD is handled for GET endpoints). This is not an explicit annotation in the code, but it is a standard framework capability.\n\n- Is POST acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable?\n  - Yes, similar to HEAD, Spring MVC generally responds to OPTIONS requests to indicate allowed methods for a mapped path. This is a framework-level behavior, not an explicit annotation in the code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable?\n  - No. There is no TRACE mapping or explicit support in the code for TRACE, and it is not typically exposed implicitly.\n\n- Is GET acceptable?\n  - Yes. The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/requests/{id}\", method = RequestMethod.GET).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable?\n  - No.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable?\n  - No.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint for getting a specific printshop request is defined as:\n  - @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/requests/{id}\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\n  - This clearly allows only GET (and, by framework behavior, HEAD and OPTIONS as described above).\n- The method is secured with @Secured({\"ROLE_MANAGER\", \"ROLE_EMPLOYEE\"}), and it returns the print request data in JSON format if the user is authorized and the requested item exists.\n- No other HTTP methods (POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH) are defined for this path, so they are not acceptable according to the code. HEAD and OPTIONS are not explicitly declared but are typically supported by the framework for GET endpoints. TRACE is not supported by this mapping."
