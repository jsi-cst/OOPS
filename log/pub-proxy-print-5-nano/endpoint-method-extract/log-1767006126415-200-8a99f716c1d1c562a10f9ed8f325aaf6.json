No. The endpoint is explicitly mapped with method = RequestMethod.GET, so only GET is allowed.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? Yes. The endpoint has a GET mapping, and in Spring MVC, HEAD requests are handled for GET mappings even though HEAD is not explicitly declared in the code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No. The mapping specifies only GET.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No. There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping or configuration shown.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No. There is no explicit TRACE mapping or configuration shown.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? Yes. The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(..., method = RequestMethod.GET).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No. The mapping does not include PUT.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No. The mapping does not include DELETE.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No. The mapping does not include PATCH.\n\nExplanation:\n- The PrintShop price table endpoint is defined by @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/pricetable\", method = RequestMethod.GET) inside PrintShopController. This restricts the endpoint to the GET method for the path /printshops/{id}/pricetable, where {id} is a path variable.\n- There are no other @RequestMapping annotations at the class or method level in this file that would add additional HTTP methods to this path.\n- HEAD is not explicitly defined but is typically handled by Spring for existing GET mappings, so it is considered acceptable based on the code’s GET mapping."
