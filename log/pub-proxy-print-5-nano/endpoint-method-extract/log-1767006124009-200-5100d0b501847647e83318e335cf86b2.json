No.\n  - The endpoint is explicitly mapped with method = RequestMethod.GET, so only GET is supported for this path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? No.\n  - There is no explicit HEAD mapping for this path; only GET is declared.\n\n- POST acceptable? No.\n  - Not declared; only GET is declared for this endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No.\n  - Not declared; only GET is declared for this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE acceptable? No.\n  - Not declared; only GET is declared for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable? Yes.\n  - The endpoint is explicitly annotated with RequestMethod.GET for /printshops/nearest.\n\n- PUT acceptable? No.\n  - Not declared; only GET is declared for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE acceptable? No.\n  - Not declared; only GET is declared for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH acceptable? No.\n  - Not declared; only GET is declared for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The method getNearestPrintShops is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/nearest\", method = RequestMethod.GET), which means this endpoint only handles GET requests to /printshops/nearest. There are no other @RequestMapping annotations in this controller method that map the same path to other HTTP methods. Therefore, only GET is acceptable for this endpoint, and all other standard methods (HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not supported by this endpoint according to the code."
