Therefore, the full path is exactly /consumer/info. There are no path parameters to wrap in curly braces.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - The endpoint is explicitly mapped only for GET (method = RequestMethod.GET). No other HTTP methods are mapped for this path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? No\n  - The code does not declare a HEAD mapping for this path. Based strictly on the code, HEAD is not explicitly supported.\n\n- POST acceptable? No\n  - Not mapped for POST for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - Not mapped for OPTIONS for this path.\n\n- TRACE acceptable? No\n  - Not mapped for TRACE for this path.\n\n- GET acceptable? Yes\n  - The method is explicitly mapped with RequestMethod.GET for /consumer/info and is the actual implemented handler.\n\n- PUT acceptable? No\n  - Not mapped for PUT for this path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable? No\n  - Not mapped for DELETE for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Not mapped for PATCH for this path.\n\nExplanation\n\n- The endpoint getConsumerInfo is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/info\", method = RequestMethod.GET), so only GET requests to /consumer/info will be handled by this method.\n- There is no class-level @RequestMapping prefix shown in the provided file, so the full path remains /consumer/info (no additional prefix).\n- The code does not provide any mappings for other HTTP methods for this path; therefore, only GET is acceptable according to the code. HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, and TRACE are not explicitly supported by this endpoint in the provided source. Note: Depending on the server/framework behavior, some environments might automatically support HEAD for GET endpoints, but this is not specified by the code itself."
