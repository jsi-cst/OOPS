        "content": "Full HTTP request path\n- /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID}\n\nReasoning: The deleteConsumerPrintingSchema method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID}\", method = RequestMethod.DELETE). The same controller also defines PUT for the same path, but DELETE is the endpoint in question.\n\nHTTP methods availability (based on code)\n- All methods acceptable? No.\n  - Explanation: Only PUT and DELETE are defined for the path /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID}. No handlers exist for other methods on this path in the provided code.\n\nHEAD\n- Acceptable? No.\n  - Explanation: There is no explicit HEAD mapping for this path, and the code only defines DELETE and PUT for this specific path. Spring does not automatically treat non-GET mappings as HEAD in a way that would make HEAD “acceptable” here the way a GET mapping would.\n\nPOST\n- Acceptable? No.\n  - Explanation: POST is defined only on the related path /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas (without the {printingSchemaID}) in addNewConsumerPrintingSchema. The path with {printingSchemaID} has only PUT and DELETE mappings.\n\nOPTIONS\n- Acceptable? Yes.\n  - Explanation: Although there is no explicit @RequestMapping for OPTIONS, Spring (in typical Spring Boot configurations) handles OPTIONS automatically for endpoints that have mappings (it responds with 200 OK and an Allow header listing the allowed methods). Since the path has PUT and DELETE mappings, OPTIONS is effectively supported by the framework for this path.\n\nTRACE\n- Acceptable? No.\n  - Explanation: There is no TRACE mapping defined for this path, and the code does not indicate any TRACE support.\n\nGET\n- Acceptable? No.\n  - Explanation: GET is defined for a different path (/consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas) in getConsumerPrintingSchemas, but not for the path with {printingSchemaID}. The specific delete/modify endpoint path does not have a GET mapping in the provided code.\n\nPUT\n- Acceptable? Yes.\n  - Explanation: The editConsumerPrintingSchema method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID}\", method = RequestMethod.PUT), so PUT is supported for this path.\n\nDELETE\n- Acceptable? Yes.\n  - Explanation: The deleteConsumerPrintingSchema method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID}\", method = RequestMethod.DELETE), so DELETE is supported for this path.\n\nPATCH\n- Acceptable? No.\n  - Explanation: There is no PATCH mapping for this path in the code.\n\nOverall explanation\n- The endpoint in question is /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID}. The controller defines PUT and DELETE handlers for this exact path, so those methods are acceptable. There are GET/POST mappings for related paths (without or with only the consumer, not the specific printingSchemaID), but not for this specific path. HEAD and TRACE are not implemented, OPTIONS is typically handled by Spring automatically because there are mappings for the path, and PATCH is not implemented. If your API has a global prefix (for example, /api or /v1) configured elsewhere, this path would be prefixed accordingly; based on the provided code, no explicit prefix is shown on this controller."
