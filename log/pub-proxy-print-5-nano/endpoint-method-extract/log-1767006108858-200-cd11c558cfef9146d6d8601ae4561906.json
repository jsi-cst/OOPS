        "content": "Here is the analysis for the /login endpoint based on the provided DefaultController.java.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /login\n  - Reason: The method handling this endpoint is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/login\", method = RequestMethod.POST). There is no class-level path prefix shown, so the full path is simply /login. There are no path parameters in this endpoint.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: Only specific methods are mapped. The endpoint /login has a POST mapping, and there is a separate OPTIONS handler for top-level paths. There is no mapping that indicates all methods are universally accepted for /login.\n\n- HEAD acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: There is no explicit @RequestMapping for HEAD on /login. The code only defines POST for /login and an OPTIONS handler for /*. Without an explicit HEAD mapping (or explicit framework behavior stated in code), HEAD is not declared acceptable by the code.\n\n- POST acceptable?: Yes\n  - Reason: The login method is specifically mapped with @RequestMapping(value = \"/login\", method = RequestMethod.POST).\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable?: Yes\n  - Reason: There is a method handleOptions() annotated with @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.OPTIONS, value = \"/*\"). The value \"/*\" matches a single path segment such as /login, so OPTIONS requests to /login are handled, returning NO_CONTENT.\n\n- TRACE acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: No TRACE mapping exists in the code for /login.\n\n- GET acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: There is no GET mapping for /login. GET mappings exist for \"/\" and \"/api/secured\", not for /login.\n\n- PUT acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: There is no PUT mapping for /login in the code.\n\n- DELETE acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: There is no DELETE mapping for /login in the code.\n\n- PATCH acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: There is no PATCH mapping for /login in the code.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The only explicit method for /login is POST (login method).\n- There is an OPTIONS handler that applies to top-level paths via \"/*\", which includes /login, so OPTIONS is also acceptable for this endpoint.\n- No explicit mappings exist for HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH on /login, and there is no evidence in code that would mark those methods as acceptable for this endpoint.\n- The path is exactly /login (no path parameters)."
