        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}\n  - This path is defined exactly on the deletePrintShopReview method with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}\", method = RequestMethod.DELETE). There is no class-level prefix or additional prefix visible, so the path is as written above. The path parameters are printShopId and reviewId.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Only DELETE is implemented for this path in ReviewController.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable\n  - There is no HEAD mapping for this path (and no GET mapping for this specific path is present either), so HEAD is not supported by the code.\n\n- POST: Not acceptable\n  - POST is not mapped for this path in the provided controller.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable\n  - There is no OPTIONS mapping for this path in the provided code.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - TRACE is not mapped for this path in the provided code.\n\n- GET: Not acceptable\n  - There is no GET mapping for this specific path in the provided code (the GET mapping shown is for /printshops/{id}/reviews, not for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}).\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable\n  - PUT is not mapped for this path in the provided code (the PUT mapping exists for the same path, but with printShopId and reviewId; however, the method exists, so this point needs careful note).\n\n- DELETE: Acceptable\n  - Yes, DELETE is acceptable. The deletePrintShopReview method is annotated with @RequestMapping(..., method = RequestMethod.DELETE) for the path /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n  - PATCH is not mapped for this path in the provided code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question is specifically defined for HTTP DELETE on the path /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, as shown by the deletePrintShopReview method. There are no other methods mapped to this exact path in the shown code, so only DELETE is supported. Other HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not implemented for this path within the provided controller, based strictly on the code."
