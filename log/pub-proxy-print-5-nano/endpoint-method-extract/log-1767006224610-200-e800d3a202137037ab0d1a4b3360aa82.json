Therefore, the exact path is /consumer/register, with no path parameters.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: No\n  - The code only defines a handler for POST on this path. There is no mapping for other methods, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable\n  - There is no handler for HEAD in this controller method. Without a separate HEAD mapping (or GET mapping that implicitly supports HEAD via the framework), HEAD is not supported by this endpoint according to the code.\n\n- POST: Acceptable\n  - The endpoint is explicitly mapped for POST only, via method = RequestMethod.POST.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path. In the code, only POST is defined. Unless the framework provides automatic OPTIONS handling (not assumed here), we should conclude OPTIONS is not defined by the code.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - No TRACE mapping is defined in the code.\n\n- GET: Not acceptable\n  - No GET mapping is defined for this path in the code.\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable\n  - No PUT mapping is defined for this path in the code.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable\n  - No DELETE mapping is defined for this path in the code.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n  - No PATCH mapping is defined for this path in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined solely by the POST mapping to /consumer/register in the ConsumerController. There are no other methods annotated for this path, nor is there any class-level @RequestMapping that would add a prefix.\n- Therefore, the only HTTP method supported by this endpoint, according to the code, is POST. All other methods are not defined for this path in the controller, so they are not acceptable from the code perspective."
