No other HTTP methods are defined for this specific operation.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - There is no explicit HEAD mapping for this endpoint. With only PUT mapped, HEAD is not supported by the code for this path.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - Although there is another method with POST on the same path (addNewCoverItem), it handles a different operation. For editCoverItem, only PUT is defined.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping defined for this endpoint. The code only defines PUT for this path.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - No TRACE mapping is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable: false\n  - No GET mapping is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- PUT acceptable: true\n  - The editCoverItem method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/pricetable/covers\", method = RequestMethod.PUT), so PUT is the only acceptable method for this operation.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - There is no DELETE mapping for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - There is no PATCH mapping for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The editCoverItem method handles HTTP requests to /printshops/{id}/pricetable/covers and is specifically mapped to PUT requests. That means this operation supports only PUT; other HTTP methods are not implemented for this endpoint in the provided code.\n- There is a separate method (addNewCoverItem) on the same path using POST, but it serves a different operation (adding new items). It does not change the fact that editCoverItem itself only accepts PUT.\n- The absence of explicit mappings for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, DELETE, and PATCH means those methods are not supported by this endpoint according to the code."
