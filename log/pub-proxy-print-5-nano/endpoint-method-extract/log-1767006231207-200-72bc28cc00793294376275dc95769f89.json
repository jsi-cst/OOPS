        "content": "Here is the analysis of the endpoint in ConsumerController.java.\n\n- Full HTTP request path\n  - /consumer/{username}/notifications\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this path?\n  - No. The code defines only two methods for this path:\n    - DELETE -> deleteAllNotifications\n    - PUT -> readAllNotifications\n  - Therefore not all HTTP methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD\n  - False. There is no GET handler for this path, and HEAD is not explicitly implemented. Spring would only map HEAD if a GET mapping exists (which it does not for this path), so HEAD is not supported based on the code.\n\n- POST\n  - False. There is no POST mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- OPTIONS\n  - True. Spring MVC typically answers OPTIONS requests automatically for mapped paths, listing allowed methods (DELETE and PUT in this case). Although not explicitly coded, the framework will respond to OPTIONS with the appropriate Allow header.\n\n- TRACE\n  - False. There is no TRACE mapping or handling in the code, and TRACE is not typically supported unless explicitly configured.\n\n- GET\n  - False. There is no GET mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- PUT\n  - True. PUT is defined for this path by readAllNotifications.\n\n- DELETE\n  - True. DELETE is defined for this path by deleteAllNotifications.\n\n- PATCH\n  - False. There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint path is defined directly on the methods in ConsumerController with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/{username}/notifications\", method = RequestMethod.DELETE) for deleteAllNotifications and @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/{username}/notifications\", method = RequestMethod.PUT) for readAllNotifications.\n- There is no class-level prefix shown in the provided file, so the path is exactly /consumer/{username}/notifications.\n- Therefore, the endpoint supports only DELETE and PUT. OPTIONS is typically handled by the framework automatically, but all other methods (GET, POST, HEAD, PATCH, TRACE) are not explicitly supported by this code."
