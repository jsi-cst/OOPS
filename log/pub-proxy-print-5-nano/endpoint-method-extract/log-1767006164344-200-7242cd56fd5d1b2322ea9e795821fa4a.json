        "content": "Here is the analysis focused on the endpoint implemented by ReviewController.getPrintShopReviews.\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint\n  - /printshops/{id}/reviews\n\n  Reason: The method getPrintShopReviews is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.GET). There is no class-level prefix, so the full path is exactly /printshops/{id}/reviews with {id} as the path variable.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No.\n  - Reason: The code defines only GET and POST mappings for this path. There is no generic catch-all mapping that accepts all methods. HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE are not defined for this exact path in this controller (PUT/DELETE exist for a different path with /reviews/{reviewId}).\n\n- HEAD: acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reason: There is no method annotated with RequestMethod.HEAD for /printshops/{id}/reviews. While some frameworks can respond to HEAD requests automatically for GET endpoints, the code does not explicitly implement HEAD handling for this path.\n\n- POST: acceptable?\n  - True\n  - Reason: There is a method addPrintShopReview mapped to POST on /printshops/{id}/reviews, which creates a new review for the specified print shop.\n\n- OPTIONS: acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reason: No explicit OPTIONS mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews is present in this controller.\n\n- TRACE: acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reason: No explicit TRACE mapping is present.\n\n- GET: acceptable?\n  - True\n  - Reason: The getPrintShopReviews method is a GET mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews and returns the list of reviews for the print shop.\n\n- PUT: acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reason: There is a PUT mapping, but it targets /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (note the additional path segment {reviewId}). It does not apply to /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- DELETE: acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reason: Like PUT, DELETE is mapped to /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, not to /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- PATCH: acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reason: There is no PATCH mapping in this controller for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\nExplanation\n- The only endpoint for /printshops/{id}/reviews is implemented with GET (getPrintShopReviews) and POST (addPrintShopReview). The other HTTP methods are either mapped to a different path (PUT/DELETE with a reviewId) or not implemented at all for this path.\n- Therefore, the accepted methods for /printshops/{id}/reviews are GET and POST. HEAD is not explicit in the code for this path, and other methods (OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH, PUT, DELETE) are not implemented for this exact path."
