        "content": "Here is the analysis for the getReviews endpoint in ReviewController.java.\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint\n  - /printshops/{id}/reviews\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. Only GET and POST are defined for the path /printshops/{id}/reviews. Other HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not mapped for this exact path in the provided code.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable for this endpoint (based on the code)?\n  - No. There is no explicit HEAD mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews, and the code does not indicate HEAD handling beyond the explicit mappings.\n\n- Is GET acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - Yes. The method getPrintShopReviews is mapped with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.GET).\n\n- Is POST acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - Yes. The method addPrintShopReview is mapped with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.POST).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No, not for this exact path. The PUT mapping is /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, which is a different path than /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No, for the exact path /printshops/{id}/reviews there is no DELETE mapping. The DELETE mapping is on /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (different path).\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no PATCH mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no TRACE mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\nExplanation:\n- The code defines two mappings on the path /printshops/{id}/reviews: GET (getPrintShopReviews) and POST (addPrintShopReview). These are the only mappings for that exact path in this controller, which means only GET and POST are supported for this endpoint as implemented.\n- Other HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not mapped to /printshops/{id}/reviews, though distinct PUT/DELETE mappings exist for a different path that includes a reviewId (i.e., /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}).\n- Therefore, the full path is /printshops/{id}/reviews, with allowed methods GET and POST for this specific endpoint, and no explicit mappings for HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/PATCH/PUT/DELETE on this exact path."
