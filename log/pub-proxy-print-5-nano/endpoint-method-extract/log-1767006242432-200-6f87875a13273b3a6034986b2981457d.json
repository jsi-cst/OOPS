        "content": "Here is the analysis based on ConsumerController.java:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /consumer/balance\n  - Reason: The method getConsumerBalance is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/balance\", method = RequestMethod.GET) and there is no class-level prefix in the provided code, so the full path is exactly /consumer/balance. There are no path parameters in curly braces.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: No\n  - Reason: The code defines only GET for this path. No other HTTP methods are mapped to this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: No\n  - Reason: There is no explicit HEAD mapping for this path in the code. Based strictly on the code, HEAD is not defined as an acceptable method.\n\n- POST: No\n  - Reason: Not mapped in the code; only GET is defined.\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Reason: Not explicitly mapped or handled in the code. Based strictly on the code, OPTIONS is not defined.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reason: Not defined in the code.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Reason: The method is explicitly mapped with RequestMethod.GET for /consumer/balance.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - Reason: Not mapped in the code.\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Reason: Not mapped in the code.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reason: Not mapped in the code.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint is defined solely by a single method annotation: @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/balance\", method = RequestMethod.GET). There is no class-level path prefix in the provided snippet, so the full path is /consumer/balance.\n- The only HTTP method allowed by the code is GET. All other HTTP methods are not defined for this endpoint in the code, so they are not considered acceptable strictly from the code perspective.\n- The decisions for HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE follow the strict code mapping. While frameworks like Spring may implicitly handle HEAD (via GET) or OPTIONS for a mapped endpoint, the request asks for decisions based on the code itself, hence they are marked as not acceptable unless explicitly defined."
