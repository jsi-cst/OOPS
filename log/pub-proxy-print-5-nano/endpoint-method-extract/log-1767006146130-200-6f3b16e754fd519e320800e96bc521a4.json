I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `src/main/java/io/github/proxyprint/kitchen/controllers/printshops/ReviewController.java`, I found that `ReviewController#getReviews` is implemented to process HTTP requests to the path `/printshops/{id}/reviews`. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

Other HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not mapped for this exact path in the provided code.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable for this endpoint (based on the code)?\n  - No. There is no explicit HEAD mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews, and the code does not indicate HEAD handling beyond the explicit mappings.\n\n- Is GET acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - Yes. The method getPrintShopReviews is mapped with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.GET).\n\n- Is POST acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - Yes. The method addPrintShopReview is mapped with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.POST).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No, not for this exact path. The PUT mapping is /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, which is a different path than /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No, for the exact path /printshops/{id}/reviews there is no DELETE mapping. The DELETE mapping is on /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (different path).\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no PATCH mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no TRACE mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\nExplanation:\n- The code defines two mappings on the path /printshops/{id}/reviews: GET (getPrintShopReviews) and POST (addPrintShopReview). These are the only mappings for that exact path in this controller, which means only GET and POST are supported for this endpoint as implemented.\n- Other HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not mapped to /printshops/{id}/reviews, though distinct PUT/DELETE mappings exist for a different path that includes a reviewId (i.e., /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}).\n- Therefore, the full path is /printshops/{id}/reviews, with allowed methods GET and POST for this specific endpoint, and no explicit mappings for HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/PATCH/PUT/DELETE on this exact path.",
