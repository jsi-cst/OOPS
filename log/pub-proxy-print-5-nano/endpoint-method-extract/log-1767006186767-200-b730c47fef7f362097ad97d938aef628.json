Therefore, only POST requests to that exact path are handled by this method. Since there are no other mappings (no class-level @RequestMapping prefix, and no additional method annotations), none of the other HTTP methods are considered acceptable for this endpoint in the code. HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH are not supported by this endpoint’s implementation."
