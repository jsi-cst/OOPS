        "content": "Here are the details for the ConsumerController.infoUpdate endpoint based on the provided code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /consumer/info/update\n  - Rationale: The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/info/update\", method = RequestMethod.PUT) and the class has no higher-level path prefix, so the full path is exactly /consumer/info/update. There are no path parameters to fill (no curly braces).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: The endpoint is explicitly mapped with method = RequestMethod.PUT, so only PUT is accepted. No other HTTP methods are configured for this path.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no mapping for HEAD on this path; only PUT is mapped.\n\n- POST method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no POST mapping for this path; only PUT is mapped.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path (and we rely on explicit mappings in code).\n\n- TRACE method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no TRACE mapping for this path.\n\n- GET method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no GET mapping for this path.\n\n- PUT method acceptable? Yes\n  - Rationale: The method is defined with method = RequestMethod.PUT, so PUT is accepted.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no DELETE mapping for this path.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined only for PUT at /consumer/info/update with @Secured(\"ROLE_USER\"), so the only HTTP method the code accepts for this path is PUT. There are no other @RequestMapping annotations for the same path with different methods, and no class-level prefix that would alter the full path. Therefore, all other HTTP methods are not acceptable for this endpoint according to the code."
