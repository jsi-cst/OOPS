        "content": "Here are the determined details for the deleteCover endpoint based on PriceTableController.java:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/{id}/pricetable/deletecover\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No. The endpoint is explicitly mapped only to POST.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No. There is no HEAD mapping for this path in the code; only POST is defined.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? Yes. The method deleteCoverItem is annotated with @RequestMapping(..., method = RequestMethod.POST).\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No. There is no OPTIONS mapping for this path in the code; only POST is defined.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No. There is no TRACE mapping for this path.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No. There is no GET mapping for this path.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No. There is no PUT mapping for this path.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No. There is no DELETE mapping for this path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No. There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/pricetable/deletecover\", method = RequestMethod.POST), which strictly maps this URL to the POST HTTP method. No other HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are mapped for this endpoint in the provided code. Therefore, only POST is acceptable for this path according to the code. HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/GET/PUT/DELETE/PATCH are not mapped here."
