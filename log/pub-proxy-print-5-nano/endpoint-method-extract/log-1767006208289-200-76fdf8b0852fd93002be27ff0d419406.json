        "content": "Here is the analysis focused on the endpoint implemented by PrintRequestController#getDocument.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /printdocument/{id}\n  - This method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printdocument/{id}\", method = RequestMethod.GET), so the path includes the path variable {id} and starts with a forward slash as required.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - The method explicitly handles only GET requests for this path. There is no mapping for other methods on /printdocument/{id} in this code.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? Yes (by default, Spring handles HEAD for GET mappings)\n  - Although there is no explicit HEAD mapping, Spring MVC provides default support for HEAD requests by mapping them to the corresponding GET handler when a GET mapping exists for the same path. Therefore HEAD is effectively acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No\n  - There is no @RequestMapping for /printdocument/{id} with POST in this controller. The only POST for /printdocument paths are /printdocument (without id) and /printdocument/{id}/budget, which are separate endpoints.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? Yes (by default, Spring handles it)\n  - Even though there is no explicit OPTIONS mapping, Spring MVC typically responds to OPTIONS requests with the allowed methods for the path based on the existing mappings (in this case, GET). Thus OPTIONS is effectively acceptable.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE mapping or default handling indicated in the code for this path.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? Yes\n  - Clearly acceptable: it is the method explicitly mapped to this endpoint (method = RequestMethod.GET).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No\n  - Not mapped for this path in the code.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - Not mapped for this path in the code.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Not mapped for this path in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint for retrieving a print document is defined by @RequestMapping(value = \"/printdocument/{id}\", method = RequestMethod.GET). Therefore, the only strictly supported HTTP method for this path is GET.\n- Spring MVC provides automatic handling for HEAD and OPTIONS requests for existing GET mappings, so those are effectively acceptable even though not explicitly declared.\n- No explicit mappings exist in this controller for the same path with POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, or TRACE, so those methods are not acceptable for /printdocument/{id} based on the given code.\n- The presence of other endpoints like /printdocument (POST) and /printdocument/{id}/budget (POST) is unrelated to the GET /printdocument/{id} endpoint and does not change the accepted methods for this specific path."
