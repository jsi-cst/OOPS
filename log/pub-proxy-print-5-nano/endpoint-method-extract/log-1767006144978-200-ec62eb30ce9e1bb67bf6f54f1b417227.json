No other methods are mapped for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- HEAD\n  - Not acceptable (no explicit HEAD mapping). The code only provides GET and POST for this path; HEAD is not defined in the controller. (Note: some frameworks can handle HEAD automatically for GET, but per the code, HEAD is not explicitly supported.)\n\n- POST\n  - Yes. There is a method addPrintShopReview with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.POST).\n\n- OPTIONS\n  - Not acceptable (no explicit OPTIONS mapping). The code does not declare an OPTIONS handler for this path.\n\n- TRACE\n  - Not acceptable (no explicit TRACE mapping). The code does not declare a TRACE handler for this path.\n\n- GET\n  - Yes. There is a method getPrintShopReviews with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.GET).\n\n- PUT\n  - No. There is a PUT mapping for a different path (\"/printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}\"), not for \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\".\n\n- DELETE\n  - No. There is a DELETE mapping for a different path (\"/printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}\"), not for \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\".\n\n- PATCH\n  - No. There is no PATCH mapping for this path anywhere in the provided code.\n\nExplanation of results:\n- The endpoint used to fetch reviews for a print shop is mapped to GET on /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n- The same path also supports creating a new review via POST (as seen in addPrintShopReview).\n- Other HTTP methods (HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not implemented for this exact path in the provided controller, so they are considered not acceptable according to the code.\n- The PUT/DELETE/PATCH methods you see in the controller apply to a different path that includes a specific review ID (e.g., /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}), not to the base path /printshops/{id}/reviews."
