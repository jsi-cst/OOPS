        "content": "Here is what the code defines for the endpoint mentioned (PrintingSchemaController#getConsumerPrintingSchemas):\n\n- Full HTTP request path:\n  - /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas\n\n  Note: This path is defined exactly as shown with the path variable consumerID. There are additional endpoints for the same base path but with an extra segment {printingSchemaID} for PUT/DELETE actions.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable on this path?\n  - No. The code explicitly maps only GET and POST for /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable?\n  - No (based strictly on the code). There is no explicit HEAD handler for this path. Spring would typically handle HEAD for GET endpoints at runtime, but that behavior is not defined in the code itself.\n\n- POST method acceptable?\n  - Yes. There is a method annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas\", method = RequestMethod.POST) which handles POST on this path.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable?\n  - No (based strictly on the code). There is no explicit handler for OPTIONS for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no TRACE mapping for this path.\n\n- GET method acceptable?\n  - Yes. There is a method annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas\", method = RequestMethod.GET) which handles GET on this path.\n\n- PUT method acceptable?\n  - No for this exact path. PUT is defined for /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID} (a different path that refers to a specific printing schema), not for /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable?\n  - No for this exact path. DELETE is defined for /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID} (a specific resource path), not for /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no PATCH mapping for this path in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The controller defines four handlers:\n  - GET /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas -> getConsumerPrintingSchemas\n  - POST /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas -> addNewConsumerPrintingSchema\n  - DELETE /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID} -> deleteConsumerPrintingSchema\n  - PUT /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas/{printingSchemaID} -> editConsumerPrintingSchema\n\n- Therefore, for the base collection path /consumer/{consumerID}/printingschemas, only GET and POST are implemented. Any explicit handling for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, or PATCH on this base path is not present in the code. PUT/DELETE/PATCH are defined only on the specific-resource path that includes /{printingSchemaID}."
