        "content": "Here is what the provided code defines for the handleOptions endpoint and which HTTP methods are supported:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /{path}\n  - Rationale: The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.OPTIONS, value = \"/*\"). There is no class-level @RequestMapping in this controller, so the path is defined at the method level. The \"/*\" pattern indicates a catch-all for a single path segment, which in OpenAPI-style表达 would be represented as a path parameter: \"/{path}\". If your application uses a server context path, the full path would be \"/{contextPath}/{path}\" (i.e., it is prefixed by the server context path, which is not shown in this file).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - Rationale: The method is explicitly mapped only for OPTIONS.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: There is no mapping for HEAD for this endpoint. Only OPTIONS is defined.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No POST mapping for this path in this method.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? Yes\n  - Rationale: This method is exactly mapped with RequestMethod.OPTIONS and returns 204 NO_CONTENT.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No TRACE mapping is defined.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No GET mapping is defined for this path.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No PUT mapping is defined for this path.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No DELETE mapping is defined for this path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: No PATCH mapping is defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The DefaultController defines a single handler for OPTIONS requests on a catch-all path segment (value = \"/*\"). This means the endpoint exists solely to respond to preflight OPTIONS requests and does not declare support for any other HTTP methods on this path.\n- Because there is no class-level path prefix shown in this file, the path is effectively at the application root as /{path} (with potential context path added if your app configures one). The actual full path in the deployed app will include any server context path configured outside this class, but the functional path pattern here is a single path segment captured as a path parameter named path.\n- The response for this OPTIONS request is 204 NO_CONTENT, reinforcing that this endpoint is intended for CORS preflight handling rather than for serving content or APIs on other methods."
