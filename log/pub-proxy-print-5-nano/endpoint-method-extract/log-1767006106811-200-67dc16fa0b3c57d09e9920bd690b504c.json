No. The code defines a single handler for this path with method DELETE, so only DELETE is acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No. There is no HEAD mapping for this path in the code; only DELETE is defined for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No. There is no POST mapping for this path; only DELETE is defined for this specific endpoint.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No. The code does not define an OPTIONS mapping for this path; only DELETE is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No. There is no TRACE mapping for this path; only DELETE is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No. There is no GET mapping for this path; only DELETE is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No. There is no PUT mapping for this path; only DELETE is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? Yes. The deleteEmployee method is explicitly mapped to /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID} with method = RequestMethod.DELETE.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No. There is no PATCH mapping for this path; only DELETE is defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The ManagerController defines a method deleteEmployee annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}\", method = RequestMethod.DELETE). This means the endpoint for deleting an employee of a printshop is strictly bound to the DELETE HTTP method on that path.\n- There are other methods in the same controller for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees (without the employeeID) using GET, POST, and PUT, but those map to a different path (without the {employeeID} parameter). They do not affect the /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID} path.\n- Since no other methods (HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are mapped to this specific path, those methods are not acceptable for this endpoint according to the code."
