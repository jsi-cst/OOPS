        "content": "Here is the analysis for the ConsumerController.updateConsumerInfo endpoint:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /consumer/info/update\n  - Reason: The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/info/update\", method = RequestMethod.PUT) and there is no class-level prefix in the controller. Therefore, the full path is exactly /consumer/info/update. There are no path parameters in this endpoint.\n\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable: false\n  - Reason: The mapping specifies method = RequestMethod.PUT, so only PUT is mapped. Other methods are not mapped to this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no handler for HEAD in this endpoint. Only PUT is defined.\n\n- POST method acceptable: false\n  - Reason: The endpoint is explicitly mapped to PUT; no POST mapping exists for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no OPTIONS mapping defined for this path in the code. OPTIONS would not be handled by this method alone.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No TRACE mapping is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- GET method acceptable: false\n  - Reason: The mapping requires PUT; there is no GET mapping for this path.\n\n- PUT method acceptable: true\n  - Reason: The endpoint is defined with method = RequestMethod.PUT, and the implementation updates consumer information accordingly.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no DELETE mapping for this path.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined as PUT /consumer/info/update and processes the request body to update consumer information. There are no other HTTP methods bound to this path in the provided code, so only PUT is acceptable. Other methods (HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, DELETE, PATCH) are not supported by this mapping according to the code. The path contains no path variables, so it’s a simple fixed path."
