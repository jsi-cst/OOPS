        "content": "Here is what the code defines for the index endpoint and how it should be represented:\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint\n  - Default path: / \n  - If the application is deployed under a non-root context path (e.g., server.contextPath or equivalent in Spring Boot 1.x), the effective path would be /{contextPath}/. For OpenAPI-style path notation that anticipates a prefix, you can represent the root as \"/{contextPath}/\". In the absence of a context path, the concrete path is \"/\".\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The controller defines only GET for the root path (\"/\"). There is no explicit mapping for other methods on this path.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable for this endpoint (based on the code, not experiential assumptions)?\n  - No. There is no explicit HEAD mapping for \"/\" in the code. While some frameworks auto-handle HEAD for GET endpoints, this is not specified by the code in DefaultController.java, so per the instruction (based on code), HEAD is not declared as acceptable here.\n\n- Is POST acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no POST mapping for \"/\".\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The only OPTIONS mapping present is for the pattern \"/*\" (which matches single-segment paths like \"/foo\"), and does not apply to the root path \"/\". Therefore, for the root path the code does not declare an OPTIONS mapping.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no TRACE mapping for \"/\".\n\n- Is GET acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - Yes. The root path \"/\" is explicitly mapped with method = RequestMethod.GET in index(ModelMap map).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no PUT mapping for \"/\".\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no DELETE mapping for \"/\".\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. There is no PATCH mapping for \"/\".\n\nExplanation of results:\n- The index endpoint is defined by:\n  - @RequestMapping(value = \"/\", method = RequestMethod.GET) which makes GET on \"/\" explicitly supported.\n- There is a separate handler for OPTIONS, but it uses value = \"/*\", which does not cover the root path \"/\". Consequently, OPTIONS is not declared for \"/\".\n- No mappings exist for HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, or TRACE on \"/\"; hence they are not supported by code for this endpoint.\n- In practice, some frameworks can automatically provide HEAD for GET endpoints, but since the task asks to decide strictly based on the code, HEAD is not considered acceptable here for the root path."
