No\n  - The controller defines specific methods for this path: POST (addNewPaperItem) and PUT (editPaperItem). There is no mapping that enables all methods for this path.\n- HEAD acceptable? No\n  - There is no @RequestMapping for HEAD on this path. Spring does not infer HEAD from PUT/POST mappings in this code, so HEAD is not exposed by the code.\n- POST acceptable? Yes\n  - The addNewPaperItem method is mapped to POST for /printshops/{id}/pricetable/papers.\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path. The code does not provide an OPTIONS method; thus, based on the code, OPTIONS is not exposed.\n- TRACE acceptable? No\n  - There is no explicit TRACE mapping. Based on the code, TRACE is not exposed.\n- GET acceptable? No\n  - There is no GET mapping for this path in the code.\n- PUT acceptable? Yes\n  - The editPaperItem method is mapped to PUT for /printshops/{id}/pricetable/papers.\n- DELETE acceptable? No\n  - There is no DELETE mapping for this path in the code.\n- PATCH acceptable? No\n  - There is no PATCH mapping for this path in the code.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint editPaperItem is defined with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/pricetable/papers\", method = RequestMethod.PUT). A corresponding create (addNewPaperItem) exists with method = RequestMethod.POST on the same path. No other HTTP verbs (GET, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) are mapped to this path in the provided code.\n- There is no class-level base path prefix in this controller, so the path is exactly as declared.\n- HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE are not provided explicitly in the code. In Spring, HEAD is typically auto-handled only if GET is supported for the same path; since there is no GET mapping here, HEAD would not be exposed by this code. OPTIONS and TRACE are also not exposed by explicit mappings in the code."
