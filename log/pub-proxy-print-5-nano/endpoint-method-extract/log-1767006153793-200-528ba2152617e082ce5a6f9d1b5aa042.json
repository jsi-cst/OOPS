No.\n  - The code defines only two methods for this path: PUT (editPrintShopReview) and DELETE (deletePrintShopReview). There are no mappings for other HTTP methods on this path.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (based on code).\n  - There is no @RequestMapping for HEAD on this path, and the code does not implement a HEAD handler.\n\n- POST: Not acceptable (based on code).\n  - No POST mapping for this path; only PUT and DELETE are defined.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable (based on code).\n  - No OPTIONS handler is defined for this path.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable (based on code).\n  - No TRACE handler is defined for this path.\n\n- GET: Not acceptable (based on code).\n  - There is no GET mapping for this path; only PUT and DELETE are defined.\n\n- PUT: Acceptable (based on code).\n  - editPrintShopReview is mapped to PUT /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} and is implemented to update the review after checks (ownership, existence).\n\n- DELETE: Acceptable (based on code).\n  - deletePrintShopReview is mapped to DELETE /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} and is implemented to remove the review after checks (ownership, existence).\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable (based on code).\n  - There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The ReviewController defines two endpoint methods for the exact path /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}: PUT for editing a review and DELETE for deleting a review.\n- There is no class-level @RequestMapping prefix that would alter the path, so the full path is exactly the one shown above.\n- The code uses security annotations requiring ROLE_USER, which further confirms that only PUT and DELETE are implemented and accessible for this specific endpoint; no other HTTP methods are handled for this path."
