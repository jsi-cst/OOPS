        "content": "Full HTTP request path for the addReview endpoint:\n- /printshops/{id}/reviews\n\nHTTP methods acceptance based on ReviewController.java\n\n- All methods acceptable: false\n  - The controller defines only GET and POST on the path /printshops/{id}/reviews (two separate mappings). No support for every method on this path.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - There is no explicit HEAD mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews. The code provides GET and POST mappings on this path, but HEAD is not defined in the controller for this endpoint.\n\n- POST: true\n  - The addPrintShopReview method is annotated with RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.POST), so POST is supported for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping in the controller for this path. (Spring may respond with allowed methods, but this is not defined by an @RequestMapping in the code.)\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - No TRACE mapping present for this path in the code.\n\n- GET: true\n  - The getPrintShopReviews method is annotated with RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.GET), so GET is supported for this path.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - No PUT mapping on /printshops/{id}/reviews for the addReview endpoint (PUT is defined for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, which is a different path).\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - No DELETE mapping on /printshops/{id}/reviews for the addReview endpoint (DELETE is defined for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, which is a different path).\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - No PATCH mapping on this path.\n\nExplanation\n- The controller defines two HTTP methods on the path /printshops/{id}/reviews: GET (to fetch reviews) and POST (to add a new review). Therefore, for the path relevant to the addReview operation, only POST is the operation implemented by this endpoint.\n- There are separate PUT/DELETE mappings for a different path /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, which handles editing and deleting a specific review, not the addReview operation on /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n- HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/PATCH are not explicitly implemented for the /printshops/{id}/reviews path in this code. While some frameworks may provide automatic handling for HEAD in conjunction with GET, the code here does not define explicit handling for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, or PATCH, so they are considered not acceptable based on the code alone."
