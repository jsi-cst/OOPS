There is no class-level prefix, so the full path is exactly /printshops/stats. No path parameters are present.\n\n- Acceptable HTTP methods (overall): false\n  - The code only defines GET for this endpoint. No other methods are implemented for this path.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - There is no explicit HEAD mapping for this path. Based on the code, only GET is defined.\n\n- POST: false\n  - No POST mapping is defined for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - No OPTIONS mapping is defined for this path.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - No TRACE mapping is defined for this path.\n\n- GET: true\n  - The endpoint is implemented with method = RequestMethod.GET, so GET is supported.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - No PUT mapping is defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - No DELETE mapping is defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - No PATCH mapping is defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\nThe Endpoint getPrintShopStatistics is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/stats\", method = RequestMethod.GET) and secured with ROLE_MANAGER. This means the endpoint is accessible only via GET requests to /printshops/stats (relative to the application context, and with no path parameters in this path). Since there are no mappings for other HTTP methods on this path, only GET is supported according to the code. We did not see any class-level prefix that would alter the path, so the full path remains /printshops/stats. HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/PUT/POST/PATCH are not defined here, so they are not supported by this code as written."
