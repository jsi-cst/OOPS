        "content": "Here are the results based on the provided NotificationsController.java and its greeting method.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /consumer/{id}/notify\n  - Explanation: The greeting method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/{id}/notify\", method = RequestMethod.POST). There is no class-level prefix, so the full path is exactly /consumer/{id}/notify. The path parameter is named id.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable?: No\n  - Explanation: The mapping restricts the method to POST only (method = RequestMethod.POST). Therefore not all HTTP methods are acceptable.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable?: No\n  - Explanation: HEAD is not defined for this endpoint in the code (only POST is mapped). Without an explicit HEAD mapping, HEAD is not acceptable based on the code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable?: Yes\n  - Explanation: The mapping explicitly specifies POST as the allowed method (method = RequestMethod.POST).\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable?: No\n  - Explanation: There is no mapping for OPTIONS for this endpoint in the code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable?: No\n  - Explanation: There is no mapping for TRACE for this endpoint in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable?: No\n  - Explanation: There is no mapping for GET for this endpoint in the code (only POST).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable?: No\n  - Explanation: There is no mapping for PUT for this endpoint in the code.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable?: No\n  - Explanation: There is no mapping for DELETE for this endpoint in the code.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable?: No\n  - Explanation: There is no mapping for PATCH for this endpoint in the code.\n\nSummary\n- The endpoint path is /consumer/{id}/notify.\n- Only POST is supported for this endpoint according to the code; all other HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not acceptable based on the code."
