No. The controller defines specific methods for this path.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No. There is no HEAD mapping for this path in the code; only PUT and DELETE are defined for this exact path, and GET is not defined for this path.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No. There is no POST mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} in the code (POST is used for /printshops/{id}/reviews, not for a specific review).\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No. There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No. There is no TRACE mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No. There is no GET mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} in the code (GET is defined for /printshops/{id}/reviews).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? Yes. There is a PUT mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (editPrintShopReview).\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? Yes. There is a DELETE mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (deletePrintShopReview).\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No. There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The ReviewController exposes endpoints for reviews with the following relevant mappings:\n  - PUT /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} to edit a review (update).\n  - DELETE /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} to delete a review.\n- There is no GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, or PATCH mapping for the exact path /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}; GET/POST exist for the collection path /printshops/{id}/reviews, not for an individual review.\n- Therefore, for the specific endpoint in updateReview, only PUT and DELETE are acceptable, and all other HTTP methods are not supported by the code."
