        "content": "Here is the analysis focused on the addNewPaperItem endpoint in PriceTableController.\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint (as required):\n  - /printshops/{id}/pricetable/papers\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No. The code defines only POST and PUT mappings for /printshops/{id}/pricetable/papers. No other methods are implemented for this path.\n\n- Is the HEAD method acceptable (based on the code)?\n  - No. There is no HEAD mapping defined for this path, and no GET mapping is present either to imply automatic HEAD handling. Based strictly on the code, HEAD is not acceptable.\n\n- Is the POST method acceptable (based on the code)?\n  - Yes. The addNewPaperItem method is explicitly annotated with @RequestMapping(..., method = RequestMethod.POST) for /printshops/{id}/pricetable/papers.\n\n- Is the OPTIONS method acceptable (based on the code)?\n  - No. There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- Is the TRACE method acceptable (based on the code)?\n  - No. There is no TRACE mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- Is the GET method acceptable (based on the code)?\n  - No. There is no GET mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- Is the PUT method acceptable (based on the code)?\n  - Yes. There is a second method editPaperItem with @RequestMapping(..., method = RequestMethod.PUT) for the same path /printshops/{id}/pricetable/papers.\n\n- Is the DELETE method acceptable (based on the code)?\n  - No. There is no DELETE mapping for this path.\n\n- Is the PATCH method acceptable (based on the code)?\n  - No. There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint addNewPaperItem is declared with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/pricetable/papers\", method = RequestMethod.POST), indicating POST is supported for that URL.\n- There is another method, editPaperItem, with the same path but method = PUT, so PUT is also supported for that URL.\n- There are no mappings for GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, DELETE, or PATCH for that URL in the provided code, so those methods are not supported by this controller for this endpoint.\n- The class does not have a class-level @RequestMapping prefix, so the path is exactly as defined in the methods (no additional prefix from the class)."
