I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `src/main/java/io/github/proxyprint/kitchen/controllers/printshops/ReviewController.java`, I found that `ReviewController#updateReview` is implemented to process HTTP requests to the path `/printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}`. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No. The controller defines specific methods for this path.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No. There is no HEAD mapping for this path in the code; only PUT and DELETE are defined for this exact path, and GET is not defined for this path.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No. There is no POST mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} in the code (POST is used for /printshops/{id}/reviews, not for a specific review).\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No. There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No. There is no TRACE mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No. There is no GET mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} in the code (GET is defined for /printshops/{id}/reviews).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? Yes. There is a PUT mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (editPrintShopReview).\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? Yes. There is a DELETE mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (deletePrintShopReview).\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No. There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The ReviewController exposes endpoints for reviews with the following relevant mappings:\n  - PUT /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} to edit a review (update).\n  - DELETE /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} to delete a review.\n- There is no GET, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, or PATCH mapping for the exact path /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}; GET/POST exist for the collection path /printshops/{id}/reviews, not for an individual review.\n- Therefore, for the specific endpoint in updateReview, only PUT and DELETE are acceptable, and all other HTTP methods are not supported by the code.",
