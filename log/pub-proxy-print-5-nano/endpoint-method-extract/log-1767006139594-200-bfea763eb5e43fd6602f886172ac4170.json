No\n  - Reason: Only GET is explicitly mapped for this endpoint. No other methods are defined.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (per code)\n  - Reason: There is no explicit HEAD mapping for this endpoint. The code only defines GET for /documents/{id}.\n\n- POST: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: No POST mapping is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: No explicit OPTIONS mapping is defined for this endpoint. (Note: some frameworks may respond to OPTIONS automatically, but per the code alone, it's not defined.)\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: No TRACE mapping is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- GET: Acceptable\n  - Reason: The method is explicitly defined with RequestMethod.GET for /documents/{id} and is the only mapped HTTP method.\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: No PUT mapping is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: No DELETE mapping is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: No PATCH mapping is defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is implemented by a single handler method annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/documents/{id}\", method = RequestMethod.GET). This means only GET is explicitly supported by this controller for this path.\n- There is no class-level @RequestMapping that would introduce a common prefix, so the path remains /documents/{id}.\n- For HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, none are declared in this code. While some frameworks may automatically handle HEAD/OPTIONS for GET endpoints, the instruction asks to determine acceptance based on the code itself, so we mark those as not acceptable unless explicitly defined."
