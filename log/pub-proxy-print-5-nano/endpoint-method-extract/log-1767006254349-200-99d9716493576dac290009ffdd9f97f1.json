There is no HEAD mapping, and there is no GET mapping for this path, so HEAD would not be handled by these methods.\n\n- POST: Not acceptable (no POST mapping for /consumer/{username}/notifications in this controller).\n\n- OPTIONS: Not explicitly acceptable based on the code. There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable (no TRACE mapping for this path).\n\n- GET: Not acceptable (no GET mapping for this path; only PUT and DELETE mappings exist for /consumer/{username}/notifications in this controller).\n\n- PUT: Acceptable (readAllNotifications is mapped to PUT for /consumer/{username}/notifications).\n\n- DELETE: Acceptable (deleteAllNotifications is mapped to DELETE for /consumer/{username}/notifications).\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable (no PATCH mapping for this path).\n\nExplanation:\n- The controller defines two mappings for the same URL path /consumer/{username}/notifications: PUT (readAllNotifications) and DELETE (deleteAllNotifications). Therefore, both PUT and DELETE are valid for that path, each invoking a separate handler. There are no mappings for GET, POST, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, or TRACE for this path, so those methods are not supported by the code for this endpoint.\n- The readAllNotifications endpoint is implemented to accept PUT; if you are specifically asking about that endpoint, PUT is the only method it uses.\n- If there is any global API prefix configured elsewhere in the project (e.g., a base path like /api), the actual deployed path would be that prefix plus /consumer/{username}/notifications. The provided code itself shows the path as /consumer/{username}/notifications."
