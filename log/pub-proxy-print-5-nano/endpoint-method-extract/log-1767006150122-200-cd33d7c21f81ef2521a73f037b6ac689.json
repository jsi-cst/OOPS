This behavior is inferred from Spring's handling of HEAD when a GET mapping exists.\n\n- POST: true\n  - addPrintShopReview is mapped with method = RequestMethod.POST for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - Spring MVC automatically supports OPTIONS for mapped paths, deriving allowed methods from the existing mappings (GET and POST) for this path.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - There is no TRACE mapping for this path, and TRACE is not defined or automatically enabled by default in this codebase.\n\n- GET: true\n  - getPrintShopReviews is mapped with method = RequestMethod.GET for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - PUT is defined for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (a different path), not for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - DELETE is defined for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (a different path), not for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - No PATCH mapping exists for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint addPrintShopReview uses @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.POST), so POST is supported for that path.\n- The same class defines a GET mapping for the same path, so GET is also supported for that path (though not for the purpose of this particular endpoint method, it contributes to the overall method support of the path).\n- HEAD is not explicitly defined but is typically handled by Spring automatically when a GET mapping exists for a path.\n- OPTIONS is generally handled automatically by Spring, exposing the allowed methods (GET, POST) for this path.\n- TRACE, PUT (on the same path), DELETE, PATCH: no corresponding mappings exist for /printshops/{id}/reviews, hence not supported by this code. The PUT/DELETE/PATCH mappings exist on a different path that includes a reviewId, not on the /reviews collection path."
