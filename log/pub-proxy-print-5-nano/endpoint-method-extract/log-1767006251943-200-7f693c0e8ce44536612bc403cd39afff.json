        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /consumer/info\n  - Rationale: The method getConsumerInfo is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/info\", method = RequestMethod.GET) and there is no class-level prefix shown in the file. Therefore, the full path for this endpoint is exactly /consumer/info. There are no path variables in this mapping (no {param} segments).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: Only GET is explicitly mapped for this endpoint. There is no mapping for other HTTP methods in this controller method.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - Rationale: The code does not declare a mapping for HEAD for this endpoint. While some frameworks may automatically handle HEAD for GET mappings, this is not explicit in the code provided, so per the instruction to base decisions on the code, HEAD is not considered acceptable here.\n\n- POST: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: No POST mapping exists for /consumer/info in this controller.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: No explicit OPTIONS mapping is declared for this endpoint in the code.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: No TRACE mapping is declared for this endpoint.\n\n- GET: Acceptable\n  - Rationale: The method is explicitly mapped with method = RequestMethod.GET for /consumer/info, so GET is supported by the code.\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: No PUT mapping exists for /consumer/info.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: No DELETE mapping exists for /consumer/info.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: No PATCH mapping exists for /consumer/info.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint is defined by a single @RequestMapping on GET for the exact path /consumer/info, with no class-level prefix present in the shown code. Consequently, only GET is explicitly supported by the code for this endpoint. Other methods (HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) have no corresponding mappings in this file, so they’re not considered acceptable based on the code alone. (Note: some frameworks may auto-handle HEAD/OPTIONS for GET endpoints, but since you asked to base decisions strictly on the code, those are not counted as acceptable here.)"
