For each of these endpoints, only the method explicitly declared in the @RequestMapping (or derived @GetMapping/@PostMapping, etc.) is allowed.\n\nIf you provide the actual endpoint1 method (or confirm the correct file containing endpoint1), I will return:\n- The exact full HTTP path starting with / and including any path parameters in {} (e.g., /api/v1/.../{id}/...).\n- For that endpoint1: whether all methods are acceptable, and the acceptability of HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, with a brief rationale based strictly on the code."
