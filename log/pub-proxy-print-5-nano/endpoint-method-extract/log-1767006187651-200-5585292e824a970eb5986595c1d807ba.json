No\n  - The method mapping for this endpoint is explicitly POST only.\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - There is no HEAD mapping or general rule in this endpoint to allow HEAD; only POST is defined.\n- POST: Acceptable\n  - The endpoint is mapped with method = RequestMethod.POST.\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping; only POST is defined.\n- TRACE: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - No TRACE mapping is present.\n- GET: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - No GET mapping is present.\n- PUT: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - No PUT mapping is present.\n- DELETE: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - No DELETE mapping is present.\n- PATCH: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - No PATCH mapping is present.\n\nExplanation:\n- The only handler for /admin/useed is useed(), which is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/admin/useed\", method = RequestMethod.POST). This means the endpoint is accessible only via POST as defined in the code.\n- None of the other HTTP methods are mapped to this path in the provided code, so they are not considered acceptable according to the code structure.\n- In some environments, servers/frameworks may respond to OPTIONS or HEAD automatically, but since the prompt requires us to base results strictly on the code, those methods are treated as not acceptable for this endpoint."
