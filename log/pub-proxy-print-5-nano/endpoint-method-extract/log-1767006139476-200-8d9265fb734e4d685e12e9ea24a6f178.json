No. The only mappings for this path are PUT (edit) and DELETE (delete). GET, POST, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE are not mapped for this exact path.\n- HEAD acceptable? No. There is no HEAD mapping for this path.\n- POST acceptable? No. POST is mapped for /printshops/{id}/reviews (without a reviewId), not for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}.\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No. There is no OPTIONS mapping defined for this path.\n- TRACE acceptable? No. There is no TRACE mapping defined for this path.\n- GET acceptable? No. There is no GET mapping for this path (the GET mapping on this controller is /printshops/{id}/reviews, without a reviewId).\n- PUT acceptable? Yes. editPrintShopReview is mapped to PUT for this path.\n- DELETE acceptable? Yes. deletePrintShopReview is mapped to DELETE for this path.\n- PATCH acceptable? No. There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The method editPrintShopReview is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}\", method = RequestMethod.PUT), making PUT the allowed method for this endpoint.\n- The file also defines another method deletePrintShopReview with the same path but method = RequestMethod.DELETE, so both PUT and DELETE are supported for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}.\n- No other HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) are mapped to this specific path in the provided code, so they are not considered acceptable for this endpoint."
