        "content": "Here are the findings for the PrintShopController#getPrintShop endpoint.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/{id}\n  - The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}\", method = RequestMethod.GET), and there is no class-level prefix in this controller, so the path is exactly /printshops/{id}.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - The endpoint is explicitly mapped only to GET. There is no annotation handling other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) for /printshops/{id}.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable? Yes\n  - Spring MVC automatically maps HEAD requests to endpoints that have a GET mapping for the same path. Although HEAD isn’t explicitly declared, it is handled by the framework for GET endpoints, so HEAD is acceptable based on the code behavior.\n\n- POST method acceptable? No\n  - No POST mapping exists for /printshops/{id} in this controller.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable? Yes\n  - Spring (DispatcherServlet) typically provides an implicit response for OPTIONS on mapped endpoints, listing allowed methods, even when not explicitly declared. While not written in code, the framework behavior makes OPTIONS effectively acceptable for this path.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE mapping or framework behavior to support TRACE for this path in the code.\n\n- GET method acceptable? Yes\n  - The endpoint is explicitly defined for GET via @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}\", method = RequestMethod.GET).\n\n- PUT method acceptable? No\n  - There is no PUT mapping for /printshops/{id} in this controller.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable? No\n  - There is no DELETE mapping for /printshops/{id} in this controller.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable? No\n  - There is no PATCH mapping for /printshops/{id} in this controller.\n\nExplanation:\n- The getPrintShop endpoint is defined with GET on /printshops/{id}, so GET is the only method explicitly supported.\n- HEAD is treated by Spring as equivalent to GET for endpoints with a GET mapping, so HEAD is effectively acceptable.\n- OPTIONS is generally handled by Spring automatically for mapped endpoints, so it is also effectively acceptable.\n- All other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not defined for this path, so they are not acceptable based on the code. The path has no broader prefix and path parameter is properly wrapped as {id}."
