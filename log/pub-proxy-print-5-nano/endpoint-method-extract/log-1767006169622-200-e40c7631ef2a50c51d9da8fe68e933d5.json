        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/{id}/pricetable/covers\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No. The endpoint has specific mappings: POST (addNewCoverItem) and PUT (editCoverItem) on the same path. No handler for other methods.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (based on code). There is no method handling HEAD for this path.\n\n- POST: Acceptable (based on code). addNewCoverItem is mapped to POST for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable (based on code). There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable (based on code). There is no TRACE mapping for this path.\n\n- GET: Not acceptable (based on code). There is no GET mapping for this path.\n\n- PUT: Acceptable (based on code). editCoverItem is mapped to PUT for this path.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable (based on code). There is no DELETE mapping for this path.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable (based on code). There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\nThe PriceTableController defines two handlers for the path /printshops/{id}/pricetable/covers: POST (addNewCoverItem) and PUT (editCoverItem). Therefore, for this endpoint, POST and PUT are the supported methods according to the code. All other HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this path in the provided code, so they are not considered acceptable based on the code. The OPTIONS and HEAD behavior in a real server could depend on framework defaults or configuration, but per the code given, they are not explicitly supported."
