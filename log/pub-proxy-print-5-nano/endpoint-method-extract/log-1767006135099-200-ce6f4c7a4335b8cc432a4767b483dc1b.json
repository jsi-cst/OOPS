I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `src/main/java/io/github/proxyprint/kitchen/controllers/printshops/ReviewController.java`, I found that `ReviewController#editPrintShopReview` is implemented to process HTTP requests to the path `/printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}`. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

No. The only mappings for this path are PUT (edit) and DELETE (delete). GET, POST, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE are not mapped for this exact path.\n- HEAD acceptable? No. There is no HEAD mapping for this path.\n- POST acceptable? No. POST is mapped for /printshops/{id}/reviews (without a reviewId), not for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}.\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No. There is no OPTIONS mapping defined for this path.\n- TRACE acceptable? No. There is no TRACE mapping defined for this path.\n- GET acceptable? No. There is no GET mapping for this path (the GET mapping on this controller is /printshops/{id}/reviews, without a reviewId).\n- PUT acceptable? Yes. editPrintShopReview is mapped to PUT for this path.\n- DELETE acceptable? Yes. deletePrintShopReview is mapped to DELETE for this path.\n- PATCH acceptable? No. There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The method editPrintShopReview is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}\", method = RequestMethod.PUT), making PUT the allowed method for this endpoint.\n- The file also defines another method deletePrintShopReview with the same path but method = RequestMethod.DELETE, so both PUT and DELETE are supported for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}.\n- No other HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE) are mapped to this specific path in the provided code, so they are not considered acceptable for this endpoint.",
