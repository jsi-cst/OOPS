        "content": "Here is the analysis for the PrintShopController#getPrintShops endpoint.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /printshops\n  - Reason: The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops\", method = RequestMethod.GET) and there is no class-level prefix shown, so the full path is exactly \"/printshops\". There are no path parameters in this mapping.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Reason: The mapping explicitly specifies only GET (method = RequestMethod.GET). No other HTTP methods are defined for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - Reason: There is no mapping for HEAD for this endpoint. While some frameworks may provide automatic HEAD handling for GET mappings, the code here does not declare HEAD as an accepted method.\n\n- POST: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in code for this endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in code for this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in code for this endpoint.\n\n- GET: Acceptable\n  - Reason: The method is explicitly mapped with GET.\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in code for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in code for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n  - Reason: Not defined in code for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint is declared with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops\", method = RequestMethod.GET) on the getPrintShops() method. This indicates a single HTTP method (GET) for the exact path \"/printshops\" with no path variables. Therefore, only GET is supported by the code, and all other methods are not accepted for this endpoint according to the source."
