        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint AdminController#getPrinShopsList\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /admin/printshops\n  - The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/admin/printshops\", method = RequestMethod.GET), and there is no class-level prefix. Therefore, the complete path is exactly /admin/printshops. There are no path parameters in curly braces.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - The endpoint only has a GET mapping for /admin/printshops. There is no explicit handler for other methods on this path.\n\n- HEAD: acceptable? Yes (based on code/framework behavior)\n  - While there is no explicit HEAD handler, Spring MVC automatically supports HEAD requests for endpoints that have a GET mapping. Since getPrinShopsList is a GET endpoint, HEAD requests to /admin/printshops would be handled (with the same response headers; the body is not sent for HEAD).\n\n- POST: acceptable? No\n  - There is no POST mapping for /admin/printshops in AdminController.\n\n- OPTIONS: acceptable? Yes (based on code/framework behavior)\n  - Spring MVC automatically handles OPTIONS requests for existing mappings, returning an Allow header with the allowed methods (in this case, GET). No explicit OPTIONS method is defined, but it will be answered by the framework.\n\n- TRACE: acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE mapping for this path, and the code does not enable TRACE handling. Typically not available unless explicitly configured.\n\n- GET: acceptable? Yes\n  - The endpoint is explicitly mapped as GET for /admin/printshops.\n\n- PUT: acceptable? No\n  - No PUT mapping exists for this path.\n\n- DELETE: acceptable? No\n  - No DELETE mapping exists for this path.\n\n- PATCH: acceptable? No\n  - No PATCH mapping exists for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined only for GET at /admin/printshops and is secured to ROLE_ADMIN. The response is a JSON payload containing the list of print shops.\n- HEAD and OPTIONS are not defined as explicit methods in code, but Spring MVC provides default handling: HEAD for GET mappings, and OPTIONS with an Allow header listing GET as the allowed method.\n- All other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not implemented for this path, so they are not acceptable based on the code."
