        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}\n  - Reason: The delete method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}\", method = RequestMethod.DELETE). There is no class-level prefix in this controller, so the full path is exactly as shown.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Reason: Only PUT and DELETE are explicitly mapped for this path in this controller (PUT for editing, DELETE for deleting). No mappings exist for GET, POST, PATCH, etc. on this exact path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - Reason: HEAD is not explicitly mapped, and Spring typically provides HEAD support only if there is a GET mapping for the same path. There is no GET mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} in this controller, so HEAD is not supported by the code.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no POST mapping for this path in the controller.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: true\n  - Reason: While not explicitly mapped with an OPTIONS method, Spring typically responds to OPTIONS requests for a path that has at least one supported method (PUT/DELETE in this case) by returning the Allow header with the supported methods. Therefore OPTIONS is effectively supported by the framework for this path.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no TRACE mapping for this path, and there is no framework-level indication that TRACE is enabled for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no GET mapping for this path in the ReviewController. The existing GET mapping on /printshops/{id}/reviews is for the collection, not for a single review.\n\n- PUT acceptable: true\n  - Reason: The editPrintShopReview method explicitly maps to PUT for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: true\n  - Reason: The deletePrintShopReview method explicitly maps to DELETE for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The configured endpoints for the path /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} are PUT (edit) and DELETE (delete). There is no GET/POST/PATCH mapping for a single review in this controller, and HEAD is not automatically supported without a GET mapping. OPTIONS is typically handled by Spring to reflect the allowed methods for the path, given the existing mappings. Therefore, the accepted methods on this endpoint are PUT and DELETE, with OPTIONS being effectively supported by the framework, and all other methods (GET, POST, PATCH, TRACE, HEAD) not supported by the code for this specific path."
