        "content": "I reviewed the provided code, but I cannot determine the full HTTP path or the accepted HTTP methods for endpoint4 as requested.\n\nWhat I can confirm from the given file:\n- The shown PrintRequestController.java does not contain any mapping for a path like /endpoint4/{type}. The methods visible map to paths such as /consumer/budget, /consumer/printrequest/{printRequestID}/submit, /printdocument, /printdocument/{id}, and /printdocument/{id}/budget.\n- There is no class-level @RequestMapping that would add a common prefix to all endpoints in this controller (no base path is evident here).\n- Therefore, based solely on the provided code snippet, I cannot reliably determine:\n  - The exact full path for /endpoint4/{type} (it could be just /endpoint4/{type} if there is no base prefix, or it could be prefixed by a class-level @RequestMapping in this class or a superclass, or by a global API prefix defined elsewhere).\n  - Which HTTP methods are accepted for endpoint4 (the method-level annotation that defines the allowed methods is not present in the snippet you shared).\n\nWhat I need to complete the task:\n- The content of the method that implements endpoint4 (the one mapped to /endpoint4/{type}) or any class-level @RequestMapping that provides a base prefix for this controller.\n- If there is any global or configuration-based base path (for example, a base API path defined in a separate configuration class or properties), please share that as well.\n\nWhat I will deliver once I have those:\n- The full HTTP request path for endpoint4, starting with a leading slash, including any applicable prefix and the path parameter {type}.\n- A boolean indicating if all HTTP methods are acceptable for this endpoint (true if the mapping uses @RequestMapping without a method attribute; false if a specific set of methods is listed).\n- For each HTTP method (HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH): a boolean indicating whether that method is acceptable, determined strictly from the code (i.e., from the presence/absence of method in @RequestMapping or equivalent annotations).\n- An explanation of the results and how they were derived from the code.\n\nIf you can share the endpoint4 method or the relevant class/file that defines the /endpoint4/{type} mapping (and any base path prefix), I’ll provide the exact answers promptly."
