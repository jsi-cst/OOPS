        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint implemented in ManagerController#getEmployees.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/{printShopID}/employees\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - The code defines specific HTTP method handlers for this path (GET, POST, PUT). There is no handler for all methods on this path, so not all methods are supported.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - There is no explicit HEAD mapping for this path in the code. The method is not implemented as a HEAD handler; the code only defines GET for this path. (No framework-level assumption about automatic HEAD handling is considered here.)\n\n- POST acceptable: true\n  - The code includes a POST mapping for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees that creates a new employee.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path, and the code does not show an OPTIONS handler.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - There is no TRACE mapping defined for this path.\n\n- GET acceptable: true\n  - The code includes a GET mapping for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees to return the list of employees.\n\n- PUT acceptable: true\n  - The code includes a PUT mapping for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees to edit an employee.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - There is a DELETE mapping for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}, but not for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees (the endpoint for getEmployees). Therefore, DELETE on this exact path is not implemented.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question (getEmployees) is explicitly mapped to GET /printshops/{printShopID}/employees, and there are separate mappings for POST and PUT on the same base path to add or edit employees. The DELETE mapping exists for a subpath that includes an employeeID, not for the base path itself. Therefore, only GET, POST, and PUT are implemented for this base path; HEAD is not explicitly implemented, and OPTIONS/TRACE/PATCH are not implemented according to the code."
