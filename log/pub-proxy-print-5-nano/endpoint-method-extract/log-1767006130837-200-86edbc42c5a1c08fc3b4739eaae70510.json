        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint implemented by PrintShopController.changeStatusPrintShopRequests.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/requests/{id}\n  - The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/requests/{id}\", method = RequestMethod.POST), i.e., it handles POST requests for that path. There is also another mapping for the same path with GET (getPrintShopRequest), so the base path is indeed /printshops/requests/{id}.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - The controller defines mappings only for POST (changeStatusPrintShopRequests) and GET (getPrintShopRequest) on this path. No mappings exist for HEAD, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, or TRACE for this path in this controller.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? No (based on code)\n  - There is no @RequestMapping with HEAD for /printshops/requests/{id}. Spring may handle HEAD if there is a GET mapping, but the code does not explicitly define HEAD, so we mark it as not acceptable per code.\n\n- POST acceptable? Yes\n  - The method changeStatusPrintShopRequests is explicitly mapped with method = RequestMethod.POST for /printshops/requests/{id}.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - There is no OPTIONS mapping defined for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE acceptable? No\n  - There is no TRACE mapping defined for this path in the code.\n\n- GET acceptable? Yes\n  - There is a separate mapping for GET on the same path: @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/requests/{id}\", method = RequestMethod.GET) for getPrintShopRequest, so GET is also supported on this path (though by a different method).\n\n- PUT acceptable? No\n  - No PUT mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- DELETE acceptable? No\n  - No DELETE mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- PATCH acceptable? No\n  - No PATCH mapping for this path in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The controller defines two endpoints on the same path /printshops/requests/{id}: POST (changeStatusPrintShopRequests) and GET (getPrintShopRequest). Therefore, the path supports POST and GET as per the code. No mappings exist for HEAD, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, or TRACE on this path, so those methods are not supported by the code for this endpoint. The concept of a \"prefix\" (like an API version or context path) is not present in the shown code, so the path is taken as given."
