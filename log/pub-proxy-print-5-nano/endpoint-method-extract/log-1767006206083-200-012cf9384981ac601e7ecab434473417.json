        "content": "I cannot determine a real endpoint3 mapping from the provided code snippet. In the given PrintRequestController.java, there is no method annotated with a path like /endpoint3 (nor any class-level prefix that would imply such a path). The file defines endpoints such as:\n\n- POST /consumer/budget\n- POST /consumer/printrequest/{printRequestID}/submit\n- POST /printdocument\n- GET /printdocument/{id}\n- POST /printdocument/{id}/budget\n\nand others, but none for /endpoint3.\n\nBecause endpoint3 is not implemented in the supplied code, the following conclusions must be “not applicable” (no real endpoint3 mapping to analyze). If an endpoint3 method existed in another part of the project, its full path and permitted HTTP methods would be determined by its @RequestMapping (and possibly class-level mappings), which are not present here.\n\nWhat I can state from the provided code\n- Full HTTP request path for endpoint3: Not available in this file. There is no /endpoint3 mapping shown.\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for endpoint3: Not applicable, since there is no endpoint3 defined here.\n- HEAD: Not applicable (endpoint3 not defined).\n- POST: Not applicable (endpoint3 not defined).\n- OPTIONS: Not applicable (endpoint3 not defined).\n- TRACE: Not applicable (endpoint3 not defined).\n- GET: Not applicable (endpoint3 not defined).\n- PUT: Not applicable (endpoint3 not defined).\n- DELETE: Not applicable (endpoint3 not defined).\n- PATCH: Not applicable (endpoint3 not defined).\n\nExplanation\n- The file clearly defines multiple endpoints, but none map to /endpoint3. Without a method annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/endpoint3\", ...) (or a class-level prefix that results in /endpoint3) there is nothing to analyze for this specific endpoint.\n- If you intended to refer to a different file or another part of the project where endpoint3 is defined, please provide that code (or confirm the correct file). Then I can extract the exact path, parameters, and supported HTTP methods and provide the required OpenAPI-ready details along with a thorough explanation."
