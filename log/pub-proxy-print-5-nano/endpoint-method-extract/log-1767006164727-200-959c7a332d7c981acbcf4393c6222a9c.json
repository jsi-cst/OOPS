No. The endpoint is mapped with method = RequestMethod.POST, so only POST is supported.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? No. There is no HEAD mapping for this URL in the code.\n\n- POST acceptable? Yes. The method deletePaperItem is explicitly mapped with POST.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No. There is no explicit mapping for OPTIONS in this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE acceptable? No. There is no TRACE mapping for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable? No. There is no GET mapping for this endpoint.\n\n- PUT acceptable? No. There is no PUT mapping for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE acceptable? No. There is no DELETE mapping for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH acceptable? No. There is no PATCH mapping for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\nThe endpoint deletePaperItem is defined with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/pricetable/deletepaper\", method = RequestMethod.POST), and there is no class-level prefix. This means the full path is exactly /printshops/{id}/pricetable/deletepaper, and only the POST method is supported by this handler. All other HTTP methods (HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not implemented for this route in the code."
