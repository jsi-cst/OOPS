Although not explicitly declared, Spring MVC will handle HEAD requests for existing GET mappings by default.\n- OPTIONS: Yes (based on framework behavior). Spring MVC will respond to OPTIONS for mapped endpoints, typically with an Allow header indicating supported methods.\n- POST: No. No mapping for POST on /consumer/requests.\n- PUT: No. No mapping for PUT on /consumer/requests.\n- DELETE: No. No mapping for DELETE on /consumer/requests.\n- PATCH: No. No mapping for PATCH on /consumer/requests.\n- TRACE: No. No mapping for TRACE on /consumer/requests.\n\nExplanation\n- The getRequests endpoint is defined with a GET mapping at /consumer/requests and is secured to ROLE_USER. There is no annotation for other HTTP verbs on this method, so only GET is explicitly supported by the code.\n- HEAD and OPTIONS are not explicitly defined but are typically handled by Spring MVC for existing mappings:\n  - HEAD requests for a GET-mapped endpoint are usually served by the same method, with a header-only response.\n  - OPTIONS requests are usually answered by the framework with an appropriate Allow header listing the supported methods for that path.\n- All other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not implemented for this endpoint in the provided code.\n\nIn summary:\n- Path: /consumer/requests\n- GET: Acceptable\n- HEAD: Acceptable (framework-handled for GET mappings)\n- OPTIONS: Acceptable (framework-handled)\n- POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH/TRACE: Not acceptable (not implemented in code)"
