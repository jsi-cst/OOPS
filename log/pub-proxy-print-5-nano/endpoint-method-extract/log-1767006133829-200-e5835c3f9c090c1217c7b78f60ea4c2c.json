        "content": "Full HTTP request path\n- /printshops/history\n\nHTTP methods acceptance (based on the code)\n\n- All methods acceptable: false\n  - The endpoint is mapped with method = RequestMethod.GET only in PrintShopController#getPrintShopHistoryRequests. No other HTTP methods are explicitly supported for this path.\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - The method is a GET mapping, and in Spring (including Spring Boot 1.x), HEAD requests are automatically handled for GET endpoints. Although HEAD is not explicitly mapped, it is supported by the framework for this route.\n\n- POST: false\n  - Not mapped for POST on /printshops/history.\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - Spring MVC provides automatic handling for OPTIONS on mapped endpoints, reflecting allowed methods (GET, and HEAD implicitly). No explicit OPTIONS method is defined, but the framework will respond accordingly.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - No TRACE mapping or support for this path is defined in the code.\n\n- GET: true\n  - Explicitly mapped as the GET method for /printshops/history.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Not mapped for PUT on /printshops/history.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Not mapped for DELETE on /printshops/history.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Not mapped for PATCH on /printshops/history.\n\nExplanation\n\n- The endpoint is defined by @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/history\", method = RequestMethod.GET) inside PrintShopController, with no class-level prefix. Therefore, the full path is /printshops/history and it only accepts GET requests as per the code.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable because Spring automatically handles HEAD for GET mappings, so a HEAD request will be served similarly to GET but without a response body.\n- OPTIONS is acceptable because the framework automatically responds to OPTIONS requests for mapped endpoints, listing allowed methods (GET, and HEAD implicitly).\n- All other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not supported by this mapping, so they are not acceptable for this endpoint."
