        "content": "Here is what the code defines for the endpoint related to notifications under a consumer, based on the ConsumerController.java you provided.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /consumer/{username}/notifications\n  - The path is defined with a path variable {username} and has a leading slash, with no extra application-wide prefix in this controller.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - For this path, only PUT and DELETE are explicitly mapped. No other HTTP methods are implemented for this path in the provided code.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No\n  - There is no method mapped to HEAD (nor a GET mapping from which HEAD could be inferred for this path). In Spring, HEAD is typically available if GET is defined for the same path; since GET is not defined here, HEAD is not supported by the code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No\n  - There is no mapping for POST on this path.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  - There is no explicit mapping for OPTIONS on this path. (Note: some frameworks can respond to OPTIONS automatically, but since you asked to determine this based on the code, it is considered not acceptable here.)\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n  - There is no mapping for TRACE on this path.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No\n  - There is no GET mapping for /consumer/{username}/notifications in the provided code.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? Yes\n  - The method readAllNotifications (PUT) is mapped to /consumer/{username}/notifications and is secured with ROLE_USER.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? Yes\n  - The method deleteAllNotifications (DELETE) is mapped to /consumer/{username}/notifications and is secured with ROLE_USER.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No\n  - There is no PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint is defined twice for the same path, once for DELETE (deleteAllNotifications) and once for PUT (readAllNotifications). This means the path /consumer/{username}/notifications supports DELETE and PUT, with the semantics:\n  - PUT -> mark all notifications as read\n  - DELETE -> remove all notifications\n- No other HTTP methods are implemented for this path in the shown code, so methods like GET, POST, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE are not supported by the code for this endpoint.\n- There is no global or class-level prefix, so the path starts with / directly.\n- The path parameter {username} must be provided by the client (e.g., /consumer/johndoe/notifications). The methods are additionally secured with ROLE_USER."
