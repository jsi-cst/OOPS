No\n  - Rationale: Only DELETE and PUT are mapped for this path. No other methods are defined for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: There is no HEAD mapping for this path in the code; only DELETE and PUT are defined.\n\n- POST: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: There is no POST mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: There is no TRACE mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- GET: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: There is no GET mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- PUT: Acceptable\n  - Rationale: The readNotification method is mapped to this path with method = RequestMethod.PUT, so PUT is supported for marking a notification as read.\n\n- DELETE: Acceptable\n  - Rationale: The deleteNotification method is mapped to this path with method = RequestMethod.DELETE, so DELETE is supported for removing a notification.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: There is no PATCH mapping for this path in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question handles /notifications/{notificationId} for DELETE (deleteNotification) and PUT (readNotification). Since the class does not declare a broader @RequestMapping prefix, the path is exactly /notifications/{notificationId}. Only the HTTP methods DELETE and PUT are implemented for this path; all other methods are not defined in this controller for this path. Therefore, only DELETE and PUT are acceptable according to the code. HEAD/POST/OPTIONS/TRACE/GET/PATCH are not supported by direct mappings in this code."
