        "content": "Here are the findings for the endpoint implemented in ConsumerController.java that handles /consumer/satisfied:\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /consumer/satisfied\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No. The method is explicitly mapped with method = RequestMethod.GET, so only GET is defined for this path.\n\n- HEAD: Yes. In Spring MVC, HTTP HEAD requests are handled for GET-mapped endpoints by default (the framework can respond to HEAD using the same logic as GET, typically without a response body). This is not explicit in code, but it is the standard behavior of the framework for a GET-mapped endpoint.\n\n- POST: No. Not mapped for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS: Yes. Spring MVC provides automatic handling of OPTIONS for mapped endpoints, indicating the allowed methods for the path.\n\n- TRACE: No. There is no TRACE mapping or configuration for this path in the code.\n\n- GET: Yes. This is the explicitly mapped method for /consumer/satisfied.\n\n- PUT: No. Not mapped for this path.\n\n- DELETE: No. Not mapped for this path.\n\n- PATCH: No. Not mapped for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined with @RequestMapping(value = \"/consumer/satisfied\", method = RequestMethod.GET), so only GET is explicitly supported for this path.\n- HEAD and OPTIONS are not explicitly declared in code, but Spring MVC provides appropriate default handling for these methods on GET-mapped endpoints (HEAD mirrors GET; OPTIONS reports allowed methods). Therefore, they are considered acceptable based on framework behavior.\n- All other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not defined for this path in the code, so they are not acceptable."
