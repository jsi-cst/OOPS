        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/{id}/pricetable/rings\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No. The endpoint is explicitly mapped only for POST in this controller method.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? No. There is no mapping for HEAD in this endpoint (no method handling HEAD is defined).\n\n- Is POST acceptable? Yes. This is the exact method implemented for addNewRingsItem:\n  - @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/pricetable/rings\", method = RequestMethod.POST)\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No. There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No. There is no TRACE mapping defined for this path.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? No. There is no GET mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No. PUT is defined for a different operation (editRingsItem) but not for this endpoint path/method; this specific method is POST-only.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No. No DELETE mapping is defined for this endpoint path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No. There is no PATCH mapping defined for this endpoint path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The addNewRingsItem method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/pricetable/rings\", method = RequestMethod.POST), and Secured(\"ROLE_MANAGER\"), which means this endpoint accepts only POST requests at the path /printshops/{id}/pricetable/rings (with {id} being a path variable). There are no other mappings for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH for this specific path in the provided code, so those methods are not considered acceptable for this endpoint based on the code alone."
