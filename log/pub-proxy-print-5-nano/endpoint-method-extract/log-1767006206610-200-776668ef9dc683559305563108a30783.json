        "content": "I cannot determine the requested endpoint details for endpoint2 from the provided file content.\n\n- Why: The provided PrintRequestController.java does not contain any method mapped to /endpoint2/{id}. The mappings I can see in this file are for other endpoints such as:\n  - POST /consumer/budget\n  - POST /consumer/printrequest/{printRequestID}/submit\n  - POST /printdocument\n  - GET /printdocument/{id}\n  - POST /printdocument/{id}/budget\n\n- What I can determine based on the code you shared:\n  - The class defines several REST endpoints with explicit HTTP methods (POST and GET) and concrete URL paths as listed above.\n  - There is no mapping in this file for a path /endpoint2/{id}, so there is no \"full path with prefix\" to output for endpoint2 here.\n  - Because there is no endpoint2 mapping in this file, there is no code-level basis in this file to declare which HTTP methods are acceptable for endpoint2.\n\nIf endpoint2/{id} is defined in another related file (as you mentioned), please provide the contents of that file (or any additional relevant files). With those, I can determine:\n- The full HTTP request path (including the correct prefix and the {id} path parameter).\n- The exact set of acceptable HTTP methods for that endpoint, overriding any defaults implied by other endpoints.\n- Whether HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH are acceptable for that endpoint, strictly based on the code.\n- An explanation of the results.\n\nNotes and context from the provided file (for reference, not as the answer to endpoint2):\n- Acceptable methods for existing endpoints in this controller are explicitly defined:\n  - POST for /consumer/budget\n  - POST for /consumer/printrequest/{printRequestID}/submit\n  - POST for /printdocument\n  - GET for /printdocument/{id}\n  - POST for /printdocument/{id}/budget\n- There is no explicit mapping for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH in this controller for these endpoints. Whether those methods are technically supported for given endpoints would depend on Spring’s default behavior or additional configuration, which is not shown in this file. However, since the question focuses on endpoint2, and endpoint2 is not present here, I cannot assert those for endpoint2 without the other file."
