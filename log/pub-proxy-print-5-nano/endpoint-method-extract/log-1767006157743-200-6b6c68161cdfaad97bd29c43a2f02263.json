No.\n  - The code defines only two mappings on the path /printshops/{id}/reviews:\n    - GET (getPrintShopReviews)\n    - POST (addPrintShopReview)\n  - There are no explicit mappings for HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH on this exact path. Therefore not all methods are acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (based strictly on the code as written).\n  - There is no explicit HEAD mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews. While some servers may auto-handle HEAD for GET endpoints, the code does not define a HEAD operation for this path.\n\n- POST: Acceptable.\n  - addPrintShopReview is implemented with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.POST).\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable (based strictly on the code as written).\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path in the code provided.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable.\n  - No explicit TRACE mapping is defined for this path in the code.\n\n- GET: Acceptable.\n  - getPrintShopReviews is implemented with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{id}/reviews\", method = RequestMethod.GET).\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable.\n  - PUT is not mapped for /printshops/{id}/reviews. There is a PUT mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, which is a different path.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable.\n  - DELETE is not mapped for /printshops/{id}/reviews. There is a DELETE mapping for /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, which is a different path.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable.\n  - There is no PATCH mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\nReasoning summary:\n- The ReviewController defines two operations on the path /printshops/{id}/reviews: GET (to fetch reviews) and POST (to add a new review). Other HTTP methods are not defined for this exact path in the provided code. Separate PUT/DELETE operations exist, but on a different path with an additional path parameter {reviewId} (/printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}), which does not apply to the /printshops/{id}/reviews endpoint."
