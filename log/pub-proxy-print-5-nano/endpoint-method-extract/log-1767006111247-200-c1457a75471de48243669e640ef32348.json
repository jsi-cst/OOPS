No\n\n- HEAD: Yes ( HEAD requests are handled by Spring for endpoints that have a GET mapping on the same path; since there is a GET mapping for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees, HEAD is effectively supported)\n\n- POST: Yes (implemented as addEmployee for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees)\n\n- OPTIONS: Yes (Spring MVC automatically responds to OPTIONS for defined mappings, listing allowed methods)\n\n- TRACE: No (no TRACE mapping is defined for this path)\n\n- GET: Yes (implemented as getEmployees for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees)\n\n- PUT: Yes (implemented as editEmployee for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees)\n\n- DELETE: No (DELETE mapping exists for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}, not for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees)\n\n- PATCH: No (no PATCH mapping defined for this path)\n\nExplanation:\n- The editEmployee method is mapped with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees\", method = RequestMethod.PUT), so PUT on /printshops/{printShopID}/employees is supported.\n- The same path is also used by getEmployees (GET) and addEmployee (POST) in the same controller, so GET and POST are supported for that path as well.\n- There is no explicit HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH mappings for this specific path, but HEAD is typically handled by Spring for GET-enabled endpoints, and OPTIONS is provided automatically for mapped endpoints. TRACE and PATCH are not implemented for this path.\n- DELETE is only defined for the path /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}, not for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees, so DELETE is not acceptable for this endpoint path."
