        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}\n  - Rationale: The deleteEmployee method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}\", method = RequestMethod.DELETE). There is no class-level prefix in this controller, so the full path is exactly as shown, with path variables in curly braces.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Rationale: The endpoint is explicitly mapped to DELETE only, via method = RequestMethod.DELETE. Other methods are not mapped for this path.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (based on code)\n  - Rationale: There is no handler for HEAD for this path. Spring will not route HEAD requests to a DELETE-mapped method, and there is no GET/HEAD-masquerading for this exact path in the code.\n\n- POST: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: The method is DELETE-only for this path; POST is not defined for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID} in this controller.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for this path in the code. OPTIONS would generally reflect allowed methods, but based on the code, only DELETE is defined for this path.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: No TRACE mapping exists for this path in the code.\n\n- GET: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: There is no GET mapping for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID} in this controller. A GET mapping exists for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees (without the employeeID), which is a different path.\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable\n  - Rationale: PUT is mapped for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees (same resource type but different path). There is no PUT mapping for /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID} in this controller.\n\n- DELETE: Acceptable\n  - Rationale: The deleteEmployee method is explicitly mapped with method = RequestMethod.DELETE for the path /printshops/{printShopID}/employees/{employeeID}, and the method executes deletion logic.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined only for the DELETE HTTP method on the specific path including both printShopID and employeeID. No other HTTP method mappings exist for this exact path in the provided code, so only DELETE is allowed for this endpoint. The absence of mappings for HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, OPTIONS, and TRACE for this precise path is why those methods are not acceptable per the code."
