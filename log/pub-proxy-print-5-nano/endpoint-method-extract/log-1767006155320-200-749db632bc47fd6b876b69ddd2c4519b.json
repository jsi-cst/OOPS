        "content": "Full HTTP request path (for the endpoint getPrintShopReviews)\n- /printshops/{id}/reviews\n\nSummary of HTTP methods acceptance based on the code (per path)\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Explanation: The controller explicitly defines GET for /printshops/{id}/reviews and POST for the same path, but there are no explicit mappings for other HTTP methods (HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) on this exact path. Therefore not all methods are supported by the code for this path.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - Explanation: There is no explicit HEAD mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews in the code. The method is annotated with RequestMethod.GET, not HEAD.\n\n- POST: true\n  - Explanation: There is an explicit mapping for POST on /printshops/{id}/reviews (addPrintShopReview).\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Explanation: No explicit OPTIONS mapping is provided for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Explanation: No explicit TRACE mapping is provided for this path.\n\n- GET: true\n  - Explanation: There is an explicit mapping for GET on /printshops/{id}/reviews (getPrintShopReviews).\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Explanation: PUT is defined for a different path: /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (editPrintShopReview). It is not mapped to /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Explanation: DELETE is defined for a different path: /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} (deletePrintShopReview). It is not mapped to /printshops/{id}/reviews.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Explanation: There is no PATCH mapping for this path in the code.\n\nOverall explanation\n- The ReviewController provides two operations on the collection path /printshops/{id}/reviews: GET (to list reviews) and POST (to add a new review). Other HTTP methods on that same path are not defined, so they are not considered acceptable by the code. Operations using PUT/DELETE/PATCH/HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE on the collection path are not implemented in this controller. The PUT/DELETE/PATCH methods in the controller apply to the item path /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId}, not to the collection path."
