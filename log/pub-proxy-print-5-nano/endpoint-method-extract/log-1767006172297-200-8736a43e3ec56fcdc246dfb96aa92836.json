Only PUT is defined.\n\n- POST acceptable: False\n  - Reason: The endpoint uses PUT; there is no POST mapping for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: False\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path. (No automatic acceptance stated by the code.)\n\n- TRACE acceptable: False\n  - Reason: No TRACE mapping present.\n\n- GET acceptable: False\n  - Reason: There is no GET mapping for this path.\n\n- PUT acceptable: True\n  - Reason: The method editStaplingPrice is annotated with @RequestMapping(..., method = RequestMethod.PUT), confirming PUT is supported.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: False\n  - Reason: No DELETE mapping for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: False\n  - Reason: No PATCH mapping for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined in PriceTableController with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/{printShopID}/pricetable/editstapling\", method = RequestMethod.PUT). Therefore, the only allowed HTTP method for this path is PUT.\n- There is no class-level @RequestMapping prefix that would alter the path; the path is exactly /printshops/{printShopID}/pricetable/editstapling, with the path variable printShopID mapped to the method parameter via @PathVariable.\n- Since the code does not define mappings for any other HTTP methods on this path, those methods are not acceptable according to the code. (Note: some frameworks may auto-handle OPTIONS/HEAD in certain configurations, but the code itself does not define those methods.)"
