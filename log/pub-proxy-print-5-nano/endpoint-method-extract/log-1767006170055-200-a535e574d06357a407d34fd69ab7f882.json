Spring MVC handles HEAD requests automatically for endpoints that have a GET mapping on the same path. The code includes a GET mapping for /printshops/{id}/reviews, so HEAD should be supported for that path.\n\n- OPTIONS: Acceptable. Spring MVC provides automatic handling for OPTIONS on mapped endpoints, so endpoints defined here will respond to OPTIONS requests with the allowed methods.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable (not implemented). There is no TRACE mapping or support in the code.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable (not implemented). There is no PATCH mapping or support in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The controller uses method-level @RequestMapping with specific HTTP methods and paths, and there is no class-level prefix. Therefore the full paths are exactly as defined:\n  - /printshops/{id}/reviews for GET and POST\n  - /printshops/{printShopId}/reviews/{reviewId} for PUT and DELETE\n- HEAD/OPTIONS are not explicitly implemented in code but are typically handled by Spring automatically based on existing mappings (GET for HEAD, and general OPTIONS handling). PATCH and TRACE are not implemented in the code, so they are not acceptable according to the code."
