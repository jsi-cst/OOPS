        "content": "Here are the results for the endpoint PrintShopController#getPrintShopRequests\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /printshops/requests\n  - Rationale: The method is annotated with @RequestMapping(value = \"/printshops/requests\", method = RequestMethod.GET) and there is no class-level prefix in the provided code, so the full path is exactly /printshops/requests. There are no path parameters to wrap in {}.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: This endpoint has only GET mapped. There is no mapping for other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.), so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - Rationale: The endpoint has a GET mapping. In Spring, HEAD requests are typically handled automatically for endpoints that have a GET mapping, even if HEAD is not explicitly declared. Since the code defines a GET mapping for this path, HEAD is effectively acceptable by the framework behavior.\n\n- POST: false\n  - Rationale: No POST mapping for /printshops/requests exists in this method (the POST mapping is for /printshops/requests/{id} in a different method).\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path in the code. The method has only GET.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit TRACE mapping for this path in the code.\n\n- GET: true\n  - Rationale: The method itself is annotated with method = RequestMethod.GET, so GET is explicitly supported.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Rationale: No PUT mapping for /printshops/requests exists in this method.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Rationale: No DELETE mapping for /printshops/requests exists in this method.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Rationale: No PATCH mapping for /printshops/requests exists in this method.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint /printshops/requests is defined by a single GET mapping in PrintShopController#getPrintShopRequests. Since there is no class-level base path shown, the path remains /printshops/requests.\n- Only GET is explicitly declared for this path, so only GET is truly supported by the code. HEAD is considered acceptable by Spring’s default behavior for GET mappings, but other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this path in the code."
