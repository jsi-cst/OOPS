        "content": "Here is what the code shows for the endpoint implemented in DefaultController.secured:\n\n- Full HTTP request path\n  - /api/secured\n  - There are no path parameters in this endpoint (no {param} in the mapping). If your app has a global prefix (context path) configured elsewhere, prepend that prefix to form the real path.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable?\n  - No. The endpoint is explicitly mapped only for GET (see below). There is no indication in this file that all methods are accepted for this path.\n\n- HEAD\n  - Acceptable (Yes). The method is not explicitly mapped for HEAD, but Spring MVC provides automatic HEAD handling for endpoints that have a GET mapping. Since /api/secured is mapped with GET, HEAD is supported by default at this path.\n\n- POST\n  - Acceptable (No). There is no POST mapping for /api/secured in this file.\n\n- OPTIONS\n  - Acceptable (No) for this specific path based on this code alone. There is a handler for OPTIONS with value \"/*\" at the class level, but that pattern does not clearly cover /api/secured (it matches a single path segment under root, e.g., /foo). Therefore, there is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for /api/secured in this code, so OPTIONS is not guaranteed to be handled for this path by the code shown.\n\n- TRACE\n  - Acceptable (No). There is no TRACE mapping for /api/secured, and there is no indication in this code that TRACE is supported for this path.\n\n- GET\n  - Acceptable (Yes). The endpoint is explicitly mapped for GET at /api/secured, with a response body produced via Gson.\n\n- PUT\n  - Acceptable (No). No PUT mapping for /api/secured.\n\n- DELETE\n  - Acceptable (No). No DELETE mapping for /api/secured.\n\n- PATCH\n  - Acceptable (No). No PATCH mapping for /api/secured.\n\nExplanation\n- The secured endpoint is declared with:\n  - @Secured({\"ROLE_USER\"})\n  - @RequestMapping(value = \"/api/secured\", method = RequestMethod.GET)\n  This clearly allows only GET for this path (along with the security constraint that the user must have ROLE_USER).\n- HEAD is not explicitly declared but is typically handled by Spring for GET endpoints, so it is effectively acceptable.\n- OPTIONS handling in this code is defined for \"/*\" at the method handleOptions, which may not match /api/secured exactly (two-level path). Therefore, there is no explicit OPTIONS mapping for this path in the provided code.\n- All other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) have no mappings for /api/secured, so they are not acceptable for this endpoint as per the code.\n\nIf you have additional files (e.g., global API prefixes or global CORS/OPTIONS handling) that modify path matching, those could affect the exact behavior, but based solely on the provided DefaultController.java, the above is the correct interpretation."
