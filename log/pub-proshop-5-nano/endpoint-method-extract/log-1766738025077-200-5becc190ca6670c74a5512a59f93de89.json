        "content": "Here is the OpenAPI-relevant determination for the getProducts endpoint based on the provided backend code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/products\n  - Reason: server.js mounts productRoutes at /api/products, and getProducts is wired to the root route ('/') of that router with GET.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? false\n  - Reason: The root /api/products route only defines GET and POST (GET for listing, POST for creating). Other methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) are not implemented for this path.\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - Reason: There is a GET handler for /api/products. Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler (no explicit HEAD route is defined).\n\n- POST: true\n  - Reason: The route '/' defines .post(protect, admin, createProduct), so POST is explicitly supported for creating a product (with authorization checks).\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - Reason: Although not explicitly defined, Express handles OPTIONS requests for existing routes by default, responding with the allowed methods. There is at least GET (and POST) defined for this path, so OPTIONS is effectively supported.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Reason: There is no TRACE handler defined for this path.\n\n- GET: true\n  - Reason: getProducts is defined and bound to GET /api/products.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Reason: No PUT handler defined for /api/products (PUT is defined only for /api/products/:id).\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Reason: No DELETE handler defined for /api/products (DELETE is defined only for /api/products/:id).\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Reason: No PATCH handler defined for /api/products (PATCH is not present anywhere for this path).\n\nExplanation\n- The routing is defined in routes/productRoutes.js with a route at '/' that supports GET and POST, and the base path is mounted at /api/products in server.js. Therefore, the root endpoint is /api/products with GET and POST available. There are no path parameters for this root endpoint (no :id on '/api/products'), so the path does not require curly-brace parameters here. Other HTTP methods are not implemented for this path, so they are not acceptable. HEAD and OPTIONS are supported by standard Express behavior given the existing GET/POST handlers."
