        "content": "Here is the endpoint information for the getMyOrders implementation, derived from the backend code you provided.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/orders/mine\n  - Rationale: In server.js, the orders router is mounted at /api/orders. In routes/orderRoutes.js, getMyOrders is registered on the /mine path (router.route('/mine').get(protect, getMyOrders)). Therefore the full path is /api/orders/mine. There are no path parameters in this endpoint.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: The route defines only GET (with protect middleware). There is no handling for other methods on this path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: true\n  - Rationale: Since a GET route is defined for /api/orders/mine, Express automatically handles HEAD requests for GET routes unless explicitly overridden. Based on the code, HEAD is effectively supported.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: Not defined for /mine in the route configuration.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: true\n  - Rationale: Express provides automatic handling of OPTIONS for routes with defined methods. Since GET is defined, OPTIONS is effectively supported as well.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: There is no TRACE handling defined, and Express does not provide TRACE support by default for this route.\n\n- GET acceptable: true\n  - Rationale: The route is explicitly registered as GET for /mine with the getMyOrders controller.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: Not defined for /mine.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: Not defined for /mine.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Rationale: Not defined for /mine.\n\nExplanation\n- The base API path for orders is /api/orders (server.js mounts orderRoutes at '/api/orders').\n- The specific endpoint for fetching the current user's orders is defined as GET /mine in routes/orderRoutes.js, which resolves to /api/orders/mine when combined with the base path.\n- The getMyOrders controller is implemented to fetch orders for req.user._id, indicating it is a private endpoint (behind protect middleware) and only supports the GET method as per the route setup.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable because Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET definition.\n- Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not defined for this path, so they are not acceptable based on the code. OPTIONS is typically handled by Express for routes with defined methods, so it is considered acceptable as well. TRACE is not supported by this route."
