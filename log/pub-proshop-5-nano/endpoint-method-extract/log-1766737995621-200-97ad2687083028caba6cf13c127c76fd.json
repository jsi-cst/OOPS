        "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /api/users/{id}\n  - Rationale: In server.js, the user routes are mounted at /api/users. In routes/userRoutes.js, the route for a specific user is defined as '/:id', which yields the full path /api/users/:id. The path parameter is id, shown in controllers as req.params.id.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - Rationale: The code only defines specific methods (GET, PUT, DELETE) for /api/users/:id. There is no route that uses .all(...) or defines every method, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: False (not explicitly defined in code for this path)\n  - Rationale: There is no HEAD handler defined for /api/users/:id. While some frameworks may handle HEAD automatically for GET, the codebase does not explicitly define HEAD, so we mark as not acceptable based on the code.\n\n- POST: False\n  - Rationale: POST for /api/users/:id is not defined in routes. POST is defined for /api/users (register) and some other paths, not for a specific user by id.\n\n- OPTIONS: False\n  - Rationale: No OPTIONS handler is defined for /api/users/:id in the code.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - Rationale: No TRACE handler is defined for /api/users/:id.\n\n- GET: True\n  - Rationale: getUserById is defined and used for GET on /api/users/:id with protect and admin middleware.\n\n- PUT: True\n  - Rationale: updateUser is defined and used for PUT on /api/users/:id with protect and admin.\n\n- DELETE: True\n  - Rationale: deleteUser is defined and used for DELETE on /api/users/:id with protect and admin.\n\n- PATCH: False\n  - Rationale: PATCH is not defined for /api/users/:id in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint getUserById is wired through the router as part of the '/:id' route under /api/users, with GET and admin protection. The same path also defines PUT (updateUser) and DELETE (deleteUser), but there are no explicit HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, POST (to this path), or PATCH definitions for this route. Therefore, the acceptable methods for this endpoint, based strictly on the code, are GET, PUT, and DELETE; other methods are not defined. The full path for getUserById is /api/users/{id}, where {id} corresponds to req.params.id in the controller."
