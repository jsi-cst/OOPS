I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `server.js`, I found that `anonymous` is implemented to process HTTP requests to the path `/api/config/paypal`. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "Here is the analysis based on the provided server.js content.\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint: /api/config/paypal\n  - Explanation: The endpoint is registered with app.get('/api/config/paypal', ...), so the full path is exactly /api/config/paypal. There are no path parameters in this route, so no curly-braced placeholders are needed.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - Explanation: Only GET is defined for this path in server.js. There is no app.post, app.put, etc., for /api/config/paypal, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: Yes (acceptable)\n  - Explanation: Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes defined with GET. Since there is an app.get('/api/config/paypal', ...), HEAD requests to this path will be handled by Express by returning the same headers as GET but without a response body.\n\n- POST: No\n  - Explanation: There is no POST handler for this path; only GET is defined.\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Explanation: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for this path, and the code does not indicate any automatic OPTIONS handling beyond general Express behavior. With no route handling OPTIONS, this is not considered acceptable based on the code.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Explanation: There is no TRACE handler for this path, and TRACE is not defined in the code.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Explanation: The endpoint is explicitly defined with app.get('/api/config/paypal', ...), so GET is supported.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - Explanation: No PUT handler defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Explanation: No DELETE handler defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Explanation: No PATCH handler defined for this path.\n\nSummary:\n- Path: /api/config/paypal\n- All methods: No\n- HEAD: Yes (handled automatically by Express for GET routes)\n- GET: Yes\n- POST: No\n- PUT: No\n- PATCH: No\n- DELETE: No\n- OPTIONS: No\n- TRACE: No\n\nExplanation in short: The endpoint is implemented only for GET at /api/config/paypal. Express will auto-handle HEAD for this route, but there are no definitions for POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, or TRACE, so those methods are not acceptable according to the code.",
