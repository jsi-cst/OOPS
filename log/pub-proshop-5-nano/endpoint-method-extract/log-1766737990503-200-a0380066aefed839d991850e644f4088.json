Since GET is defined for this path, HEAD is effectively supported by Express.\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Not explicitly defined in code for this path.\n- TRACE: false\n  - Not defined in code.\n- GET: true\n- POST: true\n- PUT: false\n- DELETE: false\n- PATCH: false\nExplanation: The route is defined as router.route('/').get(getProducts).post(protect, admin, createProduct); which enables GET and POST on /api/products.\n\n2) Endpoint: /api/products/{id}\n- HTTP methods defined in code:\n  - GET\n  - PUT\n  - DELETE\n- Path parameters: id\n- HEAD: true\n  - Rationale: Since there is a GET handler for this same path pattern, HEAD is effectively supported by Express for this route.\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Not explicitly defined for this path.\n- TRACE: false\n  - Not defined.\n- GET: true\n- POST: false\n- PUT: true\n- DELETE: true\n- PATCH: false\nExplanation: The route is defined as router\n  .route('/:id')\n  .get(checkObjectId, getProductById)\n  .put(protect, admin, checkObjectId, updateProduct)\n  .delete(protect, admin, checkObjectId, deleteProduct);\n\n3) Endpoint: /api/products/{id}/reviews\n- HTTP methods defined in code:\n  - POST\n- Path parameters: id\n- HEAD: false\n  - There is no GET handler for this path, so HEAD is not defined in code for this path.\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Not defined.\n- TRACE: false\n  - Not defined.\n- GET: false\n- POST: true\n- PUT: false\n- DELETE: false\n- PATCH: false\nExplanation: The route is defined as router.route('/:id/reviews').post(protect, checkObjectId, createProductReview);\n\n4) Endpoint: /api/products/top\n- HTTP methods defined in code:\n  - GET\n- Path parameters: none\n- HEAD: true\n  - Rationale: GET is defined for this path, so HEAD is effectively supported by Express for this route.\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Not defined.\n- TRACE: false\n  - Not defined.\n- GET: true\n- POST: false\n- PUT: false\n- DELETE: false\n- PATCH: false\nExplanation: The route is defined as router.get('/top', getTopProducts);\n\nSummary explanation\n- The full paths are constructed by combining the server-mounted prefix /api/products with the route paths defined in productRoutes.js, using curly braces for path parameters where present: {id}.\n- HTTP methods allowed are those explicitly defined in the router.route/.get/.post/.put/.delete chains.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable for a path when a GET handler exists for that exact path (Express provides implicit HEAD handling for GET routes). Therefore HEAD is true for /api/products, /api/products/{id}, and /api/products/top, and false for /api/products/{id}/reviews (which has no GET).\n- OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH are false for all endpoints here because there are no explicit handlers or .all/.options/.trace/.patch definitions in the code for these routes."
