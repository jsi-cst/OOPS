        "content": "Here is the analysis for the getTopProducts endpoint based on the provided backend code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/products/top\n\n  Rationale: In server.js, productRoutes are mounted at /api/products. In controllers/productController.js, getTopProducts is registered on the route '/top' with router.get('/top', getTopProducts). Therefore the full path is /api/products/top. There are no path parameters in this route.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n\n  Rationale: The route for /api/products/top only defines GET. There is no handler for any other method (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE, etc.), so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: true\n\n  Rationale: Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler by using the same handler and returning headers without a body. Since there is a GET handler for /api/products/top, HEAD is implicitly supported by the framework (even though not explicitly declared in the code).\n\n- POST: false\n\n  Rationale: There is no router.post('/top', ...) defined for /api/products/top.\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n\n  Rationale: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for /api/products/top, and the code does not show any global CORS or OPTIONS configuration for this route. Therefore, based on the code, OPTIONS is not acceptable.\n\n- TRACE: false\n\n  Rationale: There is no TRACE handler defined for /api/products/top, and there is no TRACE support evident in the code.\n\n- GET: true\n\n  Rationale: The route is explicitly defined as router.get('/top', getTopProducts).\n\n- PUT: false\n\n  Rationale: There is no router.put('/top', ...) for this path.\n\n- DELETE: false\n\n  Rationale: There is no router.delete('/top', ...) for this path.\n\n- PATCH: false\n\n  Rationale: There is no router.patch('/top', ...) for this path.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint getTopProducts is exposed at /api/products/top via a GET route.\n- Only GET is implemented for this path; HEAD is implicitly supported by Express for GET routes, but all other methods are not defined for this path in the code.\n- No explicit handling for OPTIONS, TRACE, POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH on /api/products/top is present in the provided code."
