        "content": "Here’s the analysis for the addOrderItems endpoint based on the provided backend files.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/orders\n  - Reason: In server.js, the orders routes are mounted under /api/orders. In routes/orderRoutes.js, the addOrderItems handler is registered on router.route('/').post(...). Therefore the full path for creating an order is /api/orders with a POST request. There are no path parameters for this endpoint, so no curly braces are needed.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: No\n  - Reason: The code only defines POST (for creating an order) and GET (for listing orders) on the /api/orders path. There are no handlers for other methods on this path.\n\n- HEAD: Yes\n  - Reason: Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler. Since GET /api/orders is defined (with protect and admin middlewares), HEAD requests to /api/orders would be answered similarly to GET, without a body. This behavior comes from Express’ default handling, not explicit code in this file.\n\n- POST: Yes\n  - Reason: addOrderItems is registered via router.route('/').post(protect, addOrderItems) in orderRoutes.js, so POST is supported.\n\n- OPTIONS: No (not implemented)\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler in the code for /api/orders, and there’s no CORS middleware shown here, so OPTIONS is not handled by the code.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reason: There is no TRACE handler anywhere in the code.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Reason: router.route('/').get(protect, admin, getOrders) defines GET on /api/orders, so GET is supported (and requires authentication and admin rights).\n\n- PUT: No (on this path)\n  - Reason: PUT is not defined for /api/orders in the provided routes. There are PUT routes for /api/orders/:id/pay and /api/orders/:id/deliver, but not for /api/orders (no id param on this path).\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Reason: There is no DELETE handler for /api/orders in the provided code.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reason: There is no PATCH handler for /api/orders in the provided code.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The addOrderItems endpoint lives at /api/orders and is exposed via POST for creating orders. GET is also exposed on the same path for listing orders (admin only). Therefore, only POST and GET are truly defined for /api/orders. HEAD is considered acceptable because Express treats HEAD as equivalent to GET for routes that have a GET handler. All other methods (OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT on this path, DELETE, PATCH) are not defined for this path in the code."
