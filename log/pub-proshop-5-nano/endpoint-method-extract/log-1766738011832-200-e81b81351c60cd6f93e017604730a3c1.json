There is no handler for other methods on this path.\n\n- HEAD: Yes\n  - Reason: Express automatically handles HEAD for routes that have a GET handler. Since GET is defined for /api/products/:id, HEAD is effectively supported as well.\n\n- POST: No\n  - Reason: POST for this path is not defined in routes/productRoutes.js. POST on /api/products is defined, but not on /api/products/:id.\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reason: No TRACE handler is defined for this path.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Reason: GET is explicitly defined for '/api/products/:id' with checkObjectId and getProductById.\n\n- PUT: Yes\n  - Reason: PUT is explicitly defined for '/api/products/:id' with checkObjectId and updateProduct (and protect/admin).\n\n- DELETE: Yes\n  - Reason: DELETE is explicitly defined for '/api/products/:id' with checkObjectId and deleteProduct (and protect/admin).\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reason: There is no PATCH handler for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The base path '/api/products' is mounted in server.js via app.use('/api/products', productRoutes).\n- The specific endpoint for getting a product by ID is defined as router.route('/:id').get(...).put(...).delete(...), which results in the full path '/api/products/:id' (represented as '/api/products/{id}' in OpenAPI notation).\n- The allowed methods for this endpoint, per the code, are GET, PUT, and DELETE. HEAD is effectively allowed by Express if a GET route exists; no explicit OPTIONS, TRACE, PATCH handlers are present."
