        "content": "- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint (as used by getOrders): /api/orders\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - Reason: The route defines only POST and GET for /api/orders in routes/orderRoutes.js:\n    - POST /api/orders → addOrderItems\n    - GET /api/orders → getOrders\n  - Other methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) are not defined for this path.\n\n- HEAD: Yes (acceptable)\n  - Reason: Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler defined. Since GET /api/orders is defined, HEAD requests to this path are effectively handled by Express.\n\n- POST: Yes\n  - Reason: POST /api/orders is defined (addOrderItems) and is protected by middleware as shown in routes/orderRoutes.js.\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for /api/orders in the code.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reason: There is no TRACE handling defined in the code.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Reason: GET /api/orders is defined (getOrders) and requires admin access via protect and admin middleware.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - Reason: PUT is not defined on /api/orders in the code (PUT methods are defined for /api/orders/:id/pay and /api/orders/:id/deliver).\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Reason: DELETE is not defined on /api/orders in the code.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reason: PATCH is not defined on /api/orders in the code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint corresponding to getOrders is mounted at /api/orders in server.js and routed in routes/orderRoutes.js.\n- The only HTTP methods explicitly defined for /api/orders are POST (addOrderItems) and GET (getOrders). HEAD is not explicit but is handled by Express for GET routes. OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, PATCH are not defined for this path, though PUT/PATCH/DELETE exist for other order endpoints like /api/orders/:id/pay and /api/orders/:id/deliver."
