        "content": "Here is the analysis based on the provided server.js and related behavior:\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint\n  - Path: /\n  - This endpoint is implemented at the root path. In development it is defined explicitly with app.get('/' ...). In production, the catch-all route app.get('*', ...) will also handle GET requests to the root path (and any other path).\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable on this endpoint?\n  - No. Only GET (and automatically HEAD due to GET) are effectively supported. Other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this path.\n\n- HEAD method acceptable?\n  - Yes. Express provides automatic HEAD handling for routes that have a GET handler. Since there is a GET route for '/' (development) and a GET catch-all for production, HEAD requests will be handled by Express without needing an explicit HEAD route.\n\n- POST method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no POST handler defined for '/'. Requests with POST will not match a route and will typically yield 404.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no explicit OPTIONS handler defined for '/'. Without an OPTIONS route, the request would not have an explicit response method defined by the app (Express would usually respond 404 unless middleware adds CORS handling).\n\n- TRACE method acceptable?\n  - No. There is no TRACE handler defined, and no automatic TRACE support is configured in this code path.\n\n- GET method acceptable?\n  - Yes. There is an explicit GET route for '/' in development, and a GET catch-all route in production (/). Therefore GET is supported.\n\n- PUT method acceptable?\n  - No. No PUT handler is defined for '/'.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable?\n  - No. No DELETE handler is defined for '/'.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable?\n  - No. No PATCH handler is defined for '/'.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is the root path '/'. In development, the code explicitly handles GET at '/'. In production, there is a catch-all GET handler for all paths ('*') which also covers '/'. HEAD is automatically handled by Express for existing GET routes. All other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this path, so they are not considered acceptable based on the code. The prefix '/api' applies to the API routes (e.g., /api/products, /api/users, /api/orders, /api/upload), but not to the root endpoint '/'. The root endpoint does not specify path parameters."
