I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `routes/uploadRoutes.js`, I found that `uploadRoutes` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "Here is the OpenAPI endpoint determination based on the provided code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/upload\n  - Reason: uploadRoutes is mounted under the prefix /api/upload in server.js, and the route inside uploadRoutes.js is defined as router.post('/', ...). Combining the prefix and the route path yields /api/upload. There are no path parameters (no curly-brace parameters) in this path.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Reason: Only POST is implemented (router.post('/', ...)). No other methods are defined for this path.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - Reason: There is no HEAD handler for /api/upload. Express would only automatically handle HEAD if there were a GET route defined for the same path, which there isn’t.\n\n- POST: true\n  - Reason: The code explicitly defines router.post('/', ...) to handle image uploads via Multer.\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for /api/upload, and the code does not provide a generic automatic OPTIONS response for this path.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Reason: No TRACE handler is defined and the code does not provide TRACE support.\n\n- GET: false\n  - Reason: There is no GET handler for /api/upload.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Reason: There is no PUT handler for /api/upload.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Reason: There is no DELETE handler for /api/upload.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Reason: There is no PATCH handler for /api/upload.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined only for POST in uploadRoutes.js and mounted at /api/upload in server.js. Since no other HTTP methods are implemented for this path, only POST is acceptable. HEAD would only be acceptable if a GET route existed (to reuse its behavior), which it does not. All other methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this path in the provided code.",
