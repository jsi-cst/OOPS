        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint getOrderById in controllers/orderController.js, using the surrounding routes and server setup.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/orders/{id}\n  - Reason: In server.js, orders routes are mounted at /api/orders. In routes/orderRoutes.js, getOrderById is registered for router.route('/:id').get(...). Therefore the full path is /api/orders/{id} with the id path parameter wrapped in curly braces.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?: No\n  - Reason: The route defines only a GET method for /api/orders/:id. There are no definitions for other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.) on this exact path.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable?: Yes\n  - Reason: Express automatically handles HEAD requests for GET routes. Since there is a GET route for this path, HEAD is effectively supported by default at this path.\n\n- Is POST acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: No POST handler is defined for /api/orders/:id. The POST route exists only for /api/orders (creating a new order) via router.route('/').post(...), not for /api/orders/{id}.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler defined for /api/orders/{id}, and the code does not show a route that responds to OPTIONS for this path.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: No TRACE handler is defined for this path in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable?: Yes\n  - Reason: The endpoint getOrderById is explicitly registered as a GET handler for /api/orders/:id with protect middleware.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: There is a PUT route for /api/orders/:id/pay and /api/orders/:id/deliver, but not for /api/orders/:id itself. So PUT on /api/orders/{id} is not defined.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: No DELETE handler is defined for /api/orders/:id.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable?: No\n  - Reason: No PATCH handler defined for /api/orders/:id.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint to retrieve an order by ID is defined as GET on /api/orders/:id with authentication (protect). The overall base path for orders is /api/orders, as seen in server.js (app.use('/api/orders', orderRoutes)).\n- While there are related endpoints for paying or delivering an order (e.g., /api/orders/:id/pay and /api/orders/:id/deliver), those are distinct routes and do not alter the allowed methods for the /api/orders/{id} GET endpoint.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable because Express automatically provides a HEAD handler for existing GET routes. All other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this exact path, hence not acceptable."
