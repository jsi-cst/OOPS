        "content": "Here is the analysis of the order-related endpoints based on the provided backend files.\n\nHow the full paths are determined\n- The app mounts the order routes at /api/orders in server.js:\n  - app.use('/api/orders', orderRoutes);\n- The routes/orderRoutes.js defines these endpoints and methods:\n  - /api/orders: POST (addOrderItems), GET (getOrders)\n  - /api/orders/mine: GET (getMyOrders)\n  - /api/orders/{id}: GET (getOrderById)\n  - /api/orders/{id}/pay: PUT (updateOrderToPaid)\n  - /api/orders/{id}/deliver: PUT (updateOrderToDelivered)\n\nFull HTTP request paths (with path parameters in braces) and their acceptable methods\n- Path: /api/orders\n  - Acceptable methods: POST, GET\n  - HEAD: Generally acceptable because Express provides automatic HEAD handling for routes that have a GET handler on the same path\n  - PUT: not defined\n  - DELETE: not defined\n  - PATCH: not defined\n  - OPTIONS: not explicitly defined in code (not handled by a dedicated route), so treated as not explicitly supported\n  - Explanation: The code defines POST (addOrderItems) and GET (getOrders) on this path. Express typically handles HEAD for GET routes, so HEAD is effectively supported. Other methods are not defined.\n\n- Path: /api/orders/mine\n  - Acceptable methods: GET\n  - HEAD: effectively acceptable (GET handler exists for this path)\n  - POST: not defined\n  - PUT: not defined\n  - DELETE: not defined\n  - PATCH: not defined\n  - OPTIONS: not explicitly defined\n  - Explanation: Only GET is defined (getMyOrders). HEAD is supported by Express if a GET exists on the path; other methods are not defined.\n\n- Path: /api/orders/{id}\n  - Acceptable methods: GET\n  - HEAD: effectively acceptable (GET handler exists for this path)\n  - POST: not defined\n  - PUT: not defined on this specific path\n  - DELETE: not defined\n  - PATCH: not defined\n  - OPTIONS: not explicitly defined\n  - Explanation: GET (getOrderById) is defined for this path. HEAD is supported due to the GET handler. Other methods are not defined here.\n\n- Path: /api/orders/{id}/pay\n  - Acceptable methods: PUT\n  - HEAD: not defined (no GET on this path), so HEAD is not explicitly supported\n  - POST: not defined\n  - GET: not defined\n  - DELETE: not defined\n  - PATCH: not defined\n  - OPTIONS: not explicitly defined\n  - Explanation: Only PUT (updateOrderToPaid) is defined for this path. Since there is no GET handler on this path, HEAD is not provided by default. Other methods are not defined.\n\n- Path: /api/orders/{id}/deliver\n  - Acceptable methods: PUT\n  - HEAD: not defined (no GET on this path), so HEAD is not explicitly supported\n  - POST: not defined\n  - GET: not defined\n  - DELETE: not defined\n  - PATCH: not defined\n  - OPTIONS: not explicitly defined\n  - Explanation: Only PUT (updateOrderToDelivered) is defined for this path. As with /pay, there is no GET on this path, so HEAD is not provided by default.\n\nOverall answers for the requested checks\n- All HTTP methods acceptable for the endpoint: false (not all methods are implemented)\n- HEAD acceptable: true for paths that have a GET handler (/api/orders, /api/orders/mine, /api/orders/{id}); false for paths without a GET handler (/api/orders/{id}/pay, /api/orders/{id}/deliver)\n- POST acceptable: true for /api/orders\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false (not explicitly handled in code)\n- TRACE acceptable: false (not defined anywhere)\n- GET acceptable: true for /api/orders, /api/orders/mine, /api/orders/{id}\n- PUT acceptable: true for /api/orders/{id}/pay and /api/orders/{id}/deliver\n- DELETE acceptable: false (not defined)\n- PATCH acceptable: false (not defined)\n\nExplanation summary\n- The base path comes from server.js where orderRoutes are mounted at /api/orders.\n- The specific endpoints and HTTP methods come directly from the router.route calls in routes/orderRoutes.js.\n- HEAD is treated as acceptable where a GET route exists on the same path (Express behavior); for endpoints that only define PUT (no GET), HEAD is not provided by default.\n- OPTIONS, TRACE, DELETE, PATCH are not implemented in the code, so they are not considered acceptable unless explicitly added."
