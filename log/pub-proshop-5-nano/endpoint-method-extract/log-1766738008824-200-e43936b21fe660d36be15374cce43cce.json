No\n  - The route for /mine defines only the GET method. No other methods are implemented for this path in the code. Therefore not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: Yes (with caveat)\n  - Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET handler. Since /api/orders/mine has a GET route (with protect middleware) defined, HEAD requests are effectively supported by the framework (they will behave like GET, typically returning the same headers and an empty body).\n  - Note: HEAD will still go through the same middleware chain (including protect) because it uses the same route logic.\n\n- POST: No\n  - There is no POST handler defined for /api/orders/mine.\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS handler defined for /api/orders/mine in the code. Without an explicit handler, OPTIONS is not guaranteed to be implemented by the code (unless the framework or middleware adds it, but that is not shown here).\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Not implemented in the code.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Explicitly defined: router.route('/mine').get(protect, getMyOrders);\n\n- PUT: No\n  - Not defined for /api/orders/mine.\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Not defined for /api/orders/mine.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Not defined for /api/orders/mine.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint is /api/orders/mine, derived from mounting the orderRoutes at /api/orders and the route /mine within that router.\n- The only explicitly supported method for this endpoint is GET, implemented via getMyOrders and protected by the protect middleware.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable because Express provides automatic HEAD handling for GET routes; however, it will still invoke the same authentication middleware as GET.\n- All other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE, OPTIONS) are not implemented for this endpoint in the provided code."
