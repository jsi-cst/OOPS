        "content": "Here are the determined values based on the provided backend code:\n\n- Full HTTP request path (for deleteUser): /api/users/{id}\n  - Reason: In routes/userRoutes.js, the deleteUser handler is registered on router.route('/:id').delete(...). The userRoutes are mounted at /api/users in server.js, so the full path becomes /api/users/{id} with the path parameter id wrapped in curly braces for OpenAPI style.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Reason: The route /api/users/{id} defines only DELETE, GET, and PUT methods. There is no blanket .all(...) covering all methods, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - Reason: There is a GET handler for /api/users/{id} (getUserById). Express implicitly supports HEAD for routes that have a GET handler, so HEAD is effectively acceptable based on the code.\n\n- POST: false\n  - Reason: There is no POST handler for /api/users/{id} in the code.\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler and no automatic handling shown in the code for this path.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Reason: No TRACE handler or support is defined in the code.\n\n- GET: true\n  - Reason: The route /api/users/{id} has a GET handler (getUserById) registered.\n\n- PUT: true\n  - Reason: The route /api/users/{id} has a PUT handler (updateUser) registered.\n\n- DELETE: true\n  - Reason: The route /api/users/{id} has a DELETE handler (deleteUser) registered.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Reason: There is no PATCH handler for /api/users/{id}.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint in question is deleteUser, which lives under /api/users/{id} due to the /api/users prefix in server.js and the '/:id' route in userRoutes.js.\n- The code defines DELETE, GET, and PUT methods for that path, so those methods are supported. HEAD is supported indirectly because GET exists for the same path. Other methods (POST, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this path in the code. The “all methods” check is false because not every HTTP method is defined on this route."
