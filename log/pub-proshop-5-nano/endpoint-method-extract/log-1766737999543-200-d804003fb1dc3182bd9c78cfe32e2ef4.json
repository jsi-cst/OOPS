Express does not automatically create a HEAD handler for non-GET routes; only PUT is defined here, so HEAD would not be handled by this endpoint.\n\n- POST method acceptable\n  - False\n  - Reason: No POST handler is defined for /api/orders/{id}/deliver; only PUT is defined.\n\n- OPTIONS method acceptable\n  - False\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler defined for this route in the code.\n\n- TRACE method acceptable\n  - False\n  - Reason: No TRACE handler is defined; typical TRACE support is not implemented in this route.\n\n- GET method acceptable\n  - False\n  - Reason: The route is mounted with PUT for /api/orders/:id/deliver, not GET.\n\n- PUT method acceptable\n  - True\n  - Reason: The route is explicitly defined as PUT with the handler updateOrderToDelivered, protected by authentication middleware.\n\n- DELETE method acceptable\n  - False\n  - Reason: No DELETE handler is defined for this route.\n\n- PATCH method acceptable\n  - False\n  - Reason: No PATCH handler is defined for this route.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question is defined in routes/orderRoutes.js as router.route('/:id/deliver').put(protect, admin, updateOrderToDelivered);, indicating the path /api/orders/:id/deliver (with id as a path parameter) and the HTTP method PUT. Therefore, only PUT is acceptable for this endpoint, and all other methods are not implemented for this path. HEAD is not automatically handled for PUT routes, and there are no dedicated OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, DELETE, PATCH, or POST handlers for this specific path. The updateOrderToDelivered controller function performs the update when a PUT request is received."
