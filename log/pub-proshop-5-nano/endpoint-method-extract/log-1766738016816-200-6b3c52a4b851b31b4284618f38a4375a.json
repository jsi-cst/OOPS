        "content": "Here is the analysis based on the provided backend source files.\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint (prefix + path): /api/products\n  - Rationale: server.js mounts productRoutes at /api/products. In routes/productRoutes.js, the createProduct implementation is wired to POST on the route '/'. Therefore the effective path for createProduct is /api/products with POST.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - Rationale: The code explicitly defines only GET and POST for the '/api/products' route:\n    - router.route('/').get(getProducts).post(protect, admin, createProduct);\n  - Other methods (HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not defined for this path in the code (no handlers for these methods on '/api/products').\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable (based on the code)\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit HEAD handler for /api/products. Although some frameworks may auto-handle HEAD for GET routes, the code here does not define or guarantee a HEAD handler for this path.\n\n- POST: Acceptable\n  - Rationale: The route explicitly defines POST on '/api/products' and wires it to createProduct, with protect and admin checks performed before creation.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable (based on the code)\n  - Rationale: No explicit OPTIONS handler is defined for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable (based on the code)\n  - Rationale: No TRACE handler is defined for this path.\n\n- GET: Acceptable\n  - Rationale: The same route defines GET on '/api/products' for listing products, implemented by getProducts.\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable (based on the code)\n  - Rationale: PUT is defined for '/api/products/:id' (updateProduct), not for '/api/products' (no such handler on this path).\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable (based on the code)\n  - Rationale: DELETE is defined for '/api/products/:id' (deleteProduct), not for '/api/products' (no such handler on this path).\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable (based on the code)\n  - Rationale: There is no PATCH handler for '/api/products' in the code.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint for createProduct is POST /api/products. The only explicitly supported methods for this path are GET and POST; HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH are not implemented for this path in the code. HEAD would rely on framework defaults (not explicitly coded here), so per code only GET and POST are guaranteed, with POST requiring authentication (protect, admin)."
