        "content": "Here is the OpenAPI endpoint determination based on the provided code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/upload\n  - Reason: uploadRoutes is mounted under the prefix /api/upload in server.js, and the route inside uploadRoutes.js is defined as router.post('/', ...). Combining the prefix and the route path yields /api/upload. There are no path parameters (no curly-brace parameters) in this path.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Reason: Only POST is implemented (router.post('/', ...)). No other methods are defined for this path.\n\n- HEAD: false\n  - Reason: There is no HEAD handler for /api/upload. Express would only automatically handle HEAD if there were a GET route defined for the same path, which there isn’t.\n\n- POST: true\n  - Reason: The code explicitly defines router.post('/', ...) to handle image uploads via Multer.\n\n- OPTIONS: false\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for /api/upload, and the code does not provide a generic automatic OPTIONS response for this path.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - Reason: No TRACE handler is defined and the code does not provide TRACE support.\n\n- GET: false\n  - Reason: There is no GET handler for /api/upload.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Reason: There is no PUT handler for /api/upload.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Reason: There is no DELETE handler for /api/upload.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Reason: There is no PATCH handler for /api/upload.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint is defined only for POST in uploadRoutes.js and mounted at /api/upload in server.js. Since no other HTTP methods are implemented for this path, only POST is acceptable. HEAD would only be acceptable if a GET route existed (to reuse its behavior), which it does not. All other methods (GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this path in the provided code."
