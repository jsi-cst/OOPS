        "content": "Here is the analysis based on the provided server.js content.\n\n- Full HTTP request path for the endpoint: /api/config/paypal\n  - Explanation: The endpoint is registered with app.get('/api/config/paypal', ...), so the full path is exactly /api/config/paypal. There are no path parameters in this route, so no curly-braced placeholders are needed.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No\n  - Explanation: Only GET is defined for this path in server.js. There is no app.post, app.put, etc., for /api/config/paypal, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD: Yes (acceptable)\n  - Explanation: Express automatically handles HEAD requests for routes defined with GET. Since there is an app.get('/api/config/paypal', ...), HEAD requests to this path will be handled by Express by returning the same headers as GET but without a response body.\n\n- POST: No\n  - Explanation: There is no POST handler for this path; only GET is defined.\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Explanation: There is no explicit OPTIONS handler for this path, and the code does not indicate any automatic OPTIONS handling beyond general Express behavior. With no route handling OPTIONS, this is not considered acceptable based on the code.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Explanation: There is no TRACE handler for this path, and TRACE is not defined in the code.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Explanation: The endpoint is explicitly defined with app.get('/api/config/paypal', ...), so GET is supported.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - Explanation: No PUT handler defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Explanation: No DELETE handler defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Explanation: No PATCH handler defined for this path.\n\nSummary:\n- Path: /api/config/paypal\n- All methods: No\n- HEAD: Yes (handled automatically by Express for GET routes)\n- GET: Yes\n- POST: No\n- PUT: No\n- PATCH: No\n- DELETE: No\n- OPTIONS: No\n- TRACE: No\n\nExplanation in short: The endpoint is implemented only for GET at /api/config/paypal. Express will auto-handle HEAD for this route, but there are no definitions for POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, or TRACE, so those methods are not acceptable according to the code."
