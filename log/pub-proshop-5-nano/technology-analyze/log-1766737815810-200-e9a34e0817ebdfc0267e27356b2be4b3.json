This doesn’t change the assessed stack, but it means dependencies aren’t visible from the root in this snapshot. The codebase itself clearly indicates Express and Node.js usage.\n- The frontend build path suggests a full-stack app with a React (or similar) frontend served from the same project in production.\n\nIf you want, I can summarize the likely routes and middleware you have based on the directory names, or outline what you’d look for to confirm Mongoose usage (e.g., inspecting config/db.js)."
