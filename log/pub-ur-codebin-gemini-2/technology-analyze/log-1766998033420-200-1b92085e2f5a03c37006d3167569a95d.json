Based on the file names provided:\n\n*   `pom.xml`: This file is a build configuration file typically used in Java projects, specifically with the Apache Maven build automation tool.\n\nTherefore, the primary programming language is likely Java, and the primary development framework is likely Spring Boot, or a similar Java-based framework, given the use of Maven.\n\nTo confirm this and gather more information, I will use the `find` command to search for files with specific extensions that are commonly associated with Java projects.\nThe output of the `find` command confirms the presence of Java source files (`.java`) within the `src` directory. The file structure and the presence of `pom.xml` strongly suggest that this is a Java project, likely using Spring Boot. The presence of files like `UrCodebinApiApplication.java`, and the package structure `com.urcodebin.api` further supports this conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Primary Programming Language:** Java\n*   **Primary Development Framework:** Likely Spring Boot (due to `pom.xml` and file structure).\n"
