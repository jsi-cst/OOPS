        "content": "- Full path: /cms/user/captcha\n\n- all HTTP methods acceptable: False\n\n- HEAD: False\n  - Reason: The route decorator explicitly lists methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\"]; HEAD is not listed in the code.\n\n- POST: True\n  - Reason: The route decorator includes \"POST\".\n\n- OPTIONS: False\n  - Reason: OPTIONS is not listed in the route's methods in the source code.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - Reason: TRACE is not listed in the route's methods in the source code.\n\n- GET: True\n  - Reason: The route decorator includes \"GET\".\n\n- PUT: False\n  - Reason: PUT is not listed in the route's methods in the source code.\n\n- DELETE: False\n  - Reason: DELETE is not listed in the route's methods in the source code.\n\n- PATCH: False\n  - Reason: PATCH is not listed in the route's methods in the source code.\n\nExplanation:\n- The route is defined in app/api/cms/user.py as @user_api.route(\"/captcha\", methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\"]). That user blueprint is registered inside the cms blueprint with url_prefix=\"/user\" (app/api/cms/__init__.py), and the cms blueprint is registered on the Flask app with url_prefix=\"/cms\" (app/__init__.py). Combining these prefixes and the route path yields /cms/user/captcha.\n- The accepted methods are determined strictly from the methods argument in the @route decorator in the provided code. Implicit framework behaviors (for example, frameworks sometimes providing HEAD when GET is present or automatic OPTIONS handling) were not assumed; only methods explicitly present in the source were considered."
