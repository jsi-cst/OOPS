        "content": "I can’t determine the endpoint path and the allowed HTTP methods from the three files you provided because the actual blueprint that implements the endpoint — the file_api blueprint — is created in app/api/cms/file.py (and the InfoCrud base may add/define routes), and that file (and/or the InfoCrud implementation) is not included.\n\nWhat I can conclude from the provided files\n- The CMS blueprint is registered at the URL prefix \"/cms\" (app/api/cms/__init__.py).\n- The file-related blueprint is registered under that CMS blueprint at the URL prefix \"/file\" (app/api/cms/__init__.py).\n- Therefore any route defined inside the file_api blueprint will be mounted under the prefix /cms/file. For example:\n  - If file_api defines a route for \"/\" (route = \"/\"), the full path will be: /cms/file\n  - If it defines a route for \"/<int:id>\", the full path will be: /cms/file/{id}\n  - If it defines other route patterns, those will be appended to /cms/file accordingly.\n\nWhat I still need to determine the precise path and allowed methods\n- Contents of app/api/cms/file.py (this is where file_api is defined; I need to see the route decorator(s), registered URL rule(s), and the methods argument(s) provided there).\n- If file_api’s routes are generated dynamically (for example by InfoCrud or other helper), I also need the implementation of InfoCrud (likely in app/lin or app/lin/*.py) to know which HTTP methods it exposes and how it names/structures routes (e.g., whether it uses /, /<id>, /<id>/something, etc.).\n\nPlease provide at least:\n- app/api/cms/file.py\nand, if file_api’s routes are created by InfoCrud or another helper:\n- the file that defines InfoCrud (for example app/lin.py or the module under app/lin that defines InfoCrud)\n\nOnce I have those, I will output:\n- the full HTTP request path(s) (with path parameters as {param})\n- whether \"all\" methods are accepted (if the implementation uses an \"all methods\" handler)\n- per-method acceptability for HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH\n- a brief explanation of how each conclusion was reached."
