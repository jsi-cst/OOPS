That yields the blueprint base path /cms + /file = /cms/file.\n- From app/extension/file/local_uploader.py:\n  - This file implements a LocalUploader.upload() helper used to store and return metadata for uploaded files, but it does not define any Flask route or HTTP method itself.\n- Missing information:\n  - The actual route(s) (e.g., \"/\", \"/upload\", \"/<id>\", etc.) and method list(s) are declared inside the file_api blueprint implementation (the file_api object and its route decorators), but that implementation was not provided. Because the route decorator(s) and their methods are not present in the supplied files, we cannot reliably determine which exact full path(s) (beyond the /cms/file prefix) or which HTTP methods are accepted.\n- Therefore I report the known prefix (/cms/file) and indicate that method acceptability cannot be concluded from the provided code. (To determine exact path(s) and methods you need to supply the file_api implementation where the routes are defined.)"
