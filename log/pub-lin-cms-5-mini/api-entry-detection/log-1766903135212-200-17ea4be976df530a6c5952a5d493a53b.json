I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

In Flask projects REST endpoints are normally defined in modules named views, routes, controllers, api, resources, or blueprints, not in config files. While any .py file could technically register a Blueprint or use route decorators, it would be unusual for a file named config.py. To be certain you should open the file, but based on naming and typical project structure it is very unlikely to contain API endpoint definitions.\"}",
