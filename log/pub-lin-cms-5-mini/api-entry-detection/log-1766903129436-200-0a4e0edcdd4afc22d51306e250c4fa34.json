I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

REST endpoints in Flask are normally defined with @app.route or Blueprint.route decorators inside controller/view modules (e.g., routes, views, controllers, or app.py). A config module would not typically import and register Flask routes, so it is very unlikely to contain API endpoint definitions.\"}",
