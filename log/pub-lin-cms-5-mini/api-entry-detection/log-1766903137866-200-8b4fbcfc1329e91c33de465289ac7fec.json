I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

Files that define REST endpoints typically import Flask/app or a Blueprint and use route decorators (@app.route, @blueprint.route). Based on the filename and common project structure, it is unlikely this file contains route/view definitions (though it might contain decorators or utilities used by endpoints). Without opening the file I cannot be certain, but the probability that it contains direct REST endpoint definitions is low.\"}",
