        "content": "You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing web projects developed using Python and the Flask framework. I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To begin this process, I'll provide you with the contents of file `app/__init__.py`, your task is to extract all instances of API entries from this file.\n\nAn API entry represents the routing functionality of the REST API framework. It refers to the structure that binds a partial or complete request path (called a \"path\") to a function, class, class method, or object (called a \"handler\") that processes requests matching that path, either by handling them directly or by dispatching them to other handlers based on the path.\n\nYou need to output a list of objects, each representing an API entry, including:\n\n- The HTTP request path, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}). Set this to null if it cannot be determined.\n- The function, class, class method, or object that handles the HTTP request. Use exactly \"anonymous\" to denote an anonymous implementation.\n- Whether the handler's implementation (i.e., processing requests and building responses) is present in the same source code file, rather than being imported.\n- Whether the path string is a prefix rather than a full path.\n- Whether the path string is extracted from a literal string defined in the source code.\n- Whether the path string is derived from a naming convention supported by the framework.\n- Whether the API entry is for a RESTful API, rather than other types of APIs.\n- Whether the API entry is intended for testing purposes, such as unit tests or functional tests.\n\nNote that all paths must be extracted from literal strings in the source code or from naming conventions explicitly supported by the REST API framework. Do not make guesses, if you find a function, class, class method, or object that looks a lot like an API implementation, but the path is not explicitly defined in this file (perhaps in another file), do not include it in your output. You also need to provide an explanation of your results."

The url_prefix strings are literal in this file, so path_is_literal = true.\n  - They are blueprint mount points (prefixes) — the blueprint will handle subpaths under these prefixes, so path_is_prefix = true.\n  - The actual blueprint factories create_v1 and create_cms are imported from other modules (not implemented in this file), so implementation_in_file = false and the handler is recorded as the imported factory name.\n  - These prefixes are used to mount API blueprints (versioned API/cms API), so they are marked is_restful = true.\n  - Not test endpoints.\n\n- /static/{filename}:\n  - No explicit literal static route is declared in this file, but creating the Flask app with a static_folder argument triggers Flask's built-in convention of registering a static file route at /static/<path:filename>. This is an explicit framework naming convention, so it is included as an implicit path (path_is_implicit = true) rather than a literal string in this file (path_is_literal = false).\n  - The Flask static route uses a path parameter; following the requested format, the parameter is represented as {filename}.\n  - The actual static file handler is provided by Flask's implementation (e.g., send_static_file), not in this file (implementation_in_file = false).\n  - Serving static files is not part of the RESTful API, so is_restful = false.\n\nNotes on exclusions:\n- register_api(app) calls api.register(app) but no literal paths or URL rules are present in this file for that registration, so individual API routes registered inside app.api.api (or other modules) are not included here per the requirement to only include paths defined as literals in this file or derived from explicit framework naming conventions.\n- Any routes defined inside the imported blueprints or other modules are not included because their path strings are not present in this file.",
