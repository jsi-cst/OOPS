I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

While it might also only contain helper classes or generator functions for SSE, these files frequently define the actual HTTP handler or a function that registers routes, so it is possible this file contains REST API endpoint definitions.\"}",
