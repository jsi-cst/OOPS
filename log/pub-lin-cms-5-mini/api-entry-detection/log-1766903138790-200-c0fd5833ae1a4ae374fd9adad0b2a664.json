I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

REST endpoints in Flask are normally defined in modules that import Flask/Blueprint and use @app.route/@blueprint.route decorators or register view classes; a config file typically does not perform that work. While technically any Python file could contain code that registers routes, it is highly unlikely for a file named config.py to define API endpoints, so this file should be treated as non-API configuration.\"}",
