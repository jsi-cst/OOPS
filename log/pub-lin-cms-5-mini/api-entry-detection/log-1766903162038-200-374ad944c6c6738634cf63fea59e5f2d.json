I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

In typical Flask projects REST endpoints live in route/view/controller/resource modules (e.g. routes, views, controllers, resources) and are decorated with @app.route or Blueprint.route or implement flask-restful Resource. A file inside a model package is almost certainly an ORM/persistence or schema definition (SQLAlchemy model, Pydantic/Marshmallow schema, or similar) used by endpoints rather than defining them. While it’s technically possible to put route handlers anywhere, the naming and folder structure make it very unlikely this file contains API endpoint definitions.\"}",
