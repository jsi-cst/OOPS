        "content": "You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing web projects developed using Python and the Flask framework. I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To begin this process, I'll provide you with the contents of file `app/api/v1/book.py`, your task is to extract all instances of API entries from this file.\n\nAn API entry represents the routing functionality of the REST API framework. It refers to the structure that binds a partial or complete request path (called a \"path\") to a function, class, class method, or object (called a \"handler\") that processes requests matching that path, either by handling them directly or by dispatching them to other handlers based on the path.\n\nYou need to output a list of objects, each representing an API entry, including:\n\n- The HTTP request path, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}). Set this to null if it cannot be determined.\n- The function, class, class method, or object that handles the HTTP request. Use exactly \"anonymous\" to denote an anonymous implementation.\n- Whether the handler's implementation (i.e., processing requests and building responses) is present in the same source code file, rather than being imported.\n- Whether the path string is a prefix rather than a full path.\n- Whether the path string is extracted from a literal string defined in the source code.\n- Whether the path string is derived from a naming convention supported by the framework.\n- Whether the API entry is for a RESTful API, rather than other types of APIs.\n- Whether the API entry is intended for testing purposes, such as unit tests or functional tests.\n\nNote that all paths must be extracted from literal strings in the source code or from naming conventions explicitly supported by the REST API framework. Do not make guesses, if you find a function, class, class method, or object that looks a lot like an API implementation, but the path is not explicitly defined in this file (perhaps in another file), do not include it in your output. You also need to provide an explanation of your results."

These are the routes bound to the local Blueprint \"book\".\n- Flask route parameter syntax <int:id> is converted to the required form {id} in the output.\n- The two occurrences of route(\"\") in the source are literal empty-route strings; in a Flask Blueprint an empty string corresponds to the root path (\"/\") of the blueprint, so I represented them as \"/\". They are still marked as extracted from literal strings (is_path_literal: true) because the source used a literal \"\".\n- Each decorated function defined in this file is the handler for its route, and the implementation is present in the same file (implementation_present: true).\n- None of the path strings are prefixes only; they are full route patterns as written (is_prefix: false).\n- Paths are explicit literal strings in the file (is_path_literal: true) and are not derived from naming conventions (is_derived_from_convention: false).\n- These endpoints implement standard CRUD-style operations on a \"book\" resource, so they are marked as RESTful (is_restful: true).\n- None of the endpoints are for testing purposes (is_testing: false).\n\nNotes and assumptions:\n- The HTTP methods are not listed in the requested output schema; where multiple functions share the same path (e.g., GET /{id}, PUT /{id}, DELETE /{id}), they are represented as separate entries because they are separate handlers in the file.\n- If the blueprint has an external url_prefix when registered elsewhere in the codebase, that prefix is not present here because it is not defined in this file; only the route literals from this file were used.",
