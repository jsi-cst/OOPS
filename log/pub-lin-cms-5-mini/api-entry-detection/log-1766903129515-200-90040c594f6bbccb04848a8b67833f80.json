To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

REST endpoints in Flask projects are typically defined in modules named views/routes/controllers/blueprints or under an api/ or routes/ package and use app.route or Blueprint objects. While an __init__.py could import code that registers blueprints at import time, that is uncommon for a CLI plugin initializer—so it is very unlikely to contain direct REST API definitions.\"}",
