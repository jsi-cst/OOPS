        "content": "[]\nExplanation:\n\n- I examined app/Http/Controllers/PostLikeController.php. It defines a controller class App\\Http\\Controllers\\PostLikeController with two public methods:\n  - store(Post $post): handles liking a Post.\n  - destroy(Post $post): handles un-liking a Post.\n\n- However, this source file does not contain any route declarations (no literal route strings such as '/posts/{post}/likes' or similar). It only contains controller method implementations. According to your instructions, an API entry's path must be extracted from a literal string in the source code or from a naming convention explicitly supported by the framework. This file does not contain literal route strings, and it does not by itself declare any resource name that would let us derive a full path from Laravel's resource-controller naming conventions.\n\n- Because the actual HTTP request paths are defined elsewhere (typically in routes/web.php or routes/api.php) and are not present in this file, I cannot deterministically produce the path values. Making guesses (for example, inferring POST /posts/{post}/likes or POST /posts/{post}/like) would violate the requirement \"Do not make guesses\" when the path is not explicitly defined in this file.\n\n- Notes for context (not included as API entries):\n  - The handler implementations are present in this file (the methods contain the request-processing code).\n  - If routes elsewhere register this controller as a resource or with explicit paths, those route definitions would be the correct source for extracting API entry paths. For example, common possibilities (not included because they are guesses) include:\n    - A nested resource registration might map store to POST /posts/{post}/likes and destroy to DELETE /posts/{post}/likes/{like}.\n    - A singular \"like\" route pattern sometimes used would map store to POST /posts/{post}/like and destroy to DELETE /posts/{post}/like.\n  - To produce concrete API entries you can either provide the corresponding routes file contents or confirm the exact route naming convention and resource name used in this project."
