I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

PasswordResetLinkController commonly implements actions for sending password-reset links and thus can contain REST endpoints (POST to request a reset link, possibly GET to show a form). While it may also be used for web views, its placement and purpose make it very likely to contain API endpoint handlers wired in routes/web.php or routes/api.php.\"}",
