        "content": "[]\nExplanation:\n\n- I found a Laravel controller class (App\\Http\\Controllers\\PostController) with two public methods: index(Request $request): View and show(Request $request, Post $post): View. These are typical controller actions that handle HTTP requests.\n- However, this source file does not contain any route/path definitions (no Route::get, Route::post, Route::resource, route attributes, or literal path strings). There are no literal strings in this file that represent HTTP paths.\n- The file also does not itself register the controller with any routing naming convention (e.g., automatic route registration) inside this file. While Laravel commonly maps controller methods to HTTP routes elsewhere (for example via Route::resource or Route::controller calls in route files), those mappings are not present here; per the instructions I must not guess or infer routes defined in other files.\n- Because there are no path literals and no routing definitions in this file, I cannot produce any API entries that meet the requirement \"paths must be extracted from literal strings in the source code or from naming conventions explicitly supported by the REST API framework\" without making guesses based on external code.\n- If you provide the route registration file(s) (e.g., routes/web.php or routes/api.php) or any explicit attribute-based routing, I can extract explicit API entries including paths and map them to these controller methods."
