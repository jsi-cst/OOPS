        "content": "You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing web projects developed using PHP and the Laravel 11.x (laravel/framework ^11.28) framework. I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To begin this process, I'll provide you with the contents of file `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`, your task is to extract all instances of API entries from this file.\n\nAn API entry represents the routing functionality of the REST API framework. It refers to the structure that binds a partial or complete request path (called a \"path\") to a function, class, class method, or object (called a \"handler\") that processes requests matching that path, either by handling them directly or by dispatching them to other handlers based on the path.\n\nYou need to output a list of objects, each representing an API entry, including:\n\n- The HTTP request path, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}). Set this to null if it cannot be determined.\n- The function, class, class method, or object that handles the HTTP request. Use exactly \"anonymous\" to denote an anonymous implementation.\n- Whether the handler's implementation (i.e., processing requests and building responses) is present in the same source code file, rather than being imported.\n- Whether the path string is a prefix rather than a full path.\n- Whether the path string is extracted from a literal string defined in the source code.\n- Whether the path string is derived from a naming convention supported by the framework.\n- Whether the API entry is for a RESTful API, rather than other types of APIs.\n- Whether the API entry is intended for testing purposes, such as unit tests or functional tests.\n\nNote that all paths must be extracted from literal strings in the source code or from naming conventions explicitly supported by the REST API framework. Do not make guesses, if you find a function, class, class method, or object that looks a lot like an API implementation, but the path is not explicitly defined in this file (perhaps in another file), do not include it in your output. You also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "[]\nExplanation:\n\n- I found two public methods in this controller that are typical HTTP handlers: create() and store(). However, this source file does not contain any route definitions or literal path strings (for example, \"/register\") that would let me determine the HTTP request path(s).\n- The file also does not include any routing registration (Route::get, Route::post, Route::resource, attributes, or route annotations) or any literal path constants. While Laravel supports controller naming conventions for resource routes (e.g., Route::resource maps create/store to specific HTTP paths), the resource name (the path prefix) is not present in this file. Because the instructions require that paths be extracted only from literal strings in the source code or from naming conventions explicitly present in the code, I did not infer or guess any paths.\n- For these reasons I produced an empty list: there are no API entries whose paths can be determined from literal strings or explicit conventions within this file. If you provide the project's route files (e.g., routes/web.php or routes/api.php) or other files that register this controller with a path, I can extract concrete API entries from those.",
