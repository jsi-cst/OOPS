According to the instructions, paths must be extracted from literal strings in the source code or from naming conventions explicitly supported by the framework and present in the same file. The file only defines a controller class and a method, but no route definitions or path literals.\n\n- What is present in this file:\n  - Class: App\\Http\\Controllers\\PostFeedController\n  - Method: index()\n  - The method contains the implementation that builds a response (it queries posts and returns an XML response). So the handler implementation is present in this file, but the HTTP path that dispatches to this handler is not present here.\n\n- Why no API entries were emitted:\n  - There are no literal route/path strings (e.g., Route::get('/feed', ...)) in this file.\n  - There are no routing annotations or explicit framework route bindings in this file.\n  - Although controllers and controller method names can be bound to routes elsewhere (routes/web.php, routes/api.php, or via Route::resource / Route::controller calls), those bindings are not present in this source file so including any path would be a guess, which the instructions forbid.\n\nIf you want entries to be produced, please provide the route definitions (for example the contents of routes/web.php or any route group files) or any files where this controller is bound to a path."
