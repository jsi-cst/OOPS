I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostCommentController.php`, I found that `App\\Http\\Controllers\\PostCommentController::index` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

For a nested resource named posts.comments the index action is routed to the URL pattern /posts/{post}/comments. The route parameter is the parent resource's singular name ({post}), which matches the controller method signature public function index(Post $post): View (route-model binding).\n- Route::resource(...)->only('index') defines the index route only. The index route is a GET route that invokes PostCommentController::index, so GET is explicitly accepted.\n- No other HTTP methods are registered in the provided route declarations for this endpoint. Following the instruction to base acceptability on the code (not on framework runtime behavior), HEAD, POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH are not explicitly registered and therefore marked not acceptable here.\n- Note: While many frameworks/web servers may implicitly handle HEAD (or respond to OPTIONS) for a defined GET route, that behavior is not present in the shown application code itself, so it was not presumed.",
