The resource(...) mapping in Laravel yields:\n  - store => POST /comments\n  - destroy => DELETE /comments/{comment}\n  Those two are the only routes generated here for App\\Http\\Controllers\\CommentController.\n\n- The store(...) method in app/Http/Controllers/CommentController.php implements creating a comment and therefore corresponds to POST /comments.\n\n- The destroy(Comment $comment) method implements deletion and therefore corresponds to DELETE /comments/{comment}. The {comment} path parameter is the route-model-bound parameter name used by resource routes.\n\n- \"All methods acceptable\" is false — only the explicitly registered methods (POST for store and DELETE for destroy) are created by the resource() call shown.\n\n- HEAD is false because no GET route is defined for these endpoints; Laravel automatically provides HEAD only for routes defined with GET. The code does not define any GET routes for these paths, so HEAD is not present based on the shown route definitions.\n\n- OPTIONS and TRACE are not explicitly defined in the provided route definitions, so they are reported false (the determination is made from the code/routes shown, per your instruction).\n\n- There is an Admin::CommentController defined in routes/admin.php that also declares resource('comments', ...) (with different allowed actions), but that is a different controller (App\\Http\\Controllers\\Admin\\CommentController). The answers above pertain only to the CommentController at app/Http/Controllers/CommentController.php as requested."
