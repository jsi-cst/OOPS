The Admin PostController implementation that will be used by that route is located at app/Http/Controllers/Admin/PostController.php. This file contains the controller actions used by the admin resource routes (index, create, store, edit, update, destroy).\n- There are two other classes named PostController in the codebase, but they belong to different namespaces and are not the ones referenced by routes/admin.php:\n  - app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php (top-level web/front-end controller)\n  - app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostController.php (API controller)\n- I located these files by searching for class PostController declarations (grep found three matches). The Admin controller file is the one referenced by routes/admin.php because of the namespace App\\Http\\Controllers\\Admin used in that routes file."
