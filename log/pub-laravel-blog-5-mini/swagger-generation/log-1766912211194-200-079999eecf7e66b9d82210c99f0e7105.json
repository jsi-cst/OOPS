I'm now focusing on endpoint `/comments` with method POST, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/CommentController.php`, `CommentController` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/comments` with HTTP method POST.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/CommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\CommentController::store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/comments` with HTTP method POST.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\", followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "Explanation:\n\n- The store method in CommentController returns response()->turboStream([...]) and its declared return type is MultiplePendingTurboStreamResponse. That indicates a successful response is an HTTP 200 with Turbo Stream payload (MIME type used by Turbo Streams is typically text/vnd.turbo-stream.html) containing multiple <turbo-stream> fragments (prepend, replace, update).\n- Validation is handled by CommentsRequest (a FormRequest). If validation fails, Laravel returns a 422 Unprocessable Entity with a JSON payload describing validation errors.\n- Authentication is required (the code uses Auth::user()). If the caller is not authenticated the typical responses are an authentication failure — in many Laravel apps this is a 401 (API) or a redirect (web). For an API-style spec include 401 Unauthorized.\n- No explicit 201 or other success codes are returned by this controller, so the success response is modeled as 200 OK with Turbo Stream content.\n- I will provide three response objects: 200 (Turbo Stream), 422 (validation errors), and 401 (unauthenticated). Each response object contains a description and an example payload (examples keyed by MIME type), and no $ref.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"200\": {\n    \"description\": \"OK.
