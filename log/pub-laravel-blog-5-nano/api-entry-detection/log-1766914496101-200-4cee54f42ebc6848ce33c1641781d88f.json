To initiate this process, I'll provide you with the path to a file, your task is to determine whether it is possible for this file to contain definitions of REST API endpoints, rather than just project configuration, feature implementation, database operations, unit tests, or functional tests. You need to follow the structured output, including an indication of whether this file contains API entries and the reasoning behind your judgment."

While it could also define web UI routes, its primary role is to map URLs to controllers, so it is plausible that this file contains API endpoints rather than being only configuration, feature implementation, DB operations, or tests.\"}",
