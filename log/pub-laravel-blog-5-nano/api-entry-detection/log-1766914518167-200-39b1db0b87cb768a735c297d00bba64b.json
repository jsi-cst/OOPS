        "content": "You are an AI assistant specialized in analyzing web projects developed using PHP and the Laravel framework. I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. To begin this process, I'll provide you with the contents of file `routes/admin.php`, your task is to extract all instances of API entries from this file.\n\nAn API entry represents the routing functionality of the REST API framework. It refers to the structure that binds a partial or complete request path (called a \"path\") to a function, class, class method, or object (called a \"handler\") that processes requests matching that path, either by handling them directly or by dispatching them to other handlers based on the path.\n\nYou need to output a list of objects, each representing an API entry, including:\n\n- The HTTP request path, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}). Set this to null if it cannot be determined.\n- The function, class, class method, or object that handles the HTTP request. Use exactly \"anonymous\" to denote an anonymous implementation.\n- Whether the handler's implementation (i.e., processing requests and building responses) is present in the same source code file, rather than being imported.\n- Whether the path string is a prefix rather than a full path.\n- Whether the path string is extracted from a literal string defined in the source code.\n- Whether the path string is derived from a naming convention supported by the framework.\n- Whether the API entry is for a RESTful API, rather than other types of APIs.\n- Whether the API entry is intended for testing purposes, such as unit tests or functional tests.\n\nNote that all paths must be extracted from literal strings in the source code or from naming conventions explicitly supported by the REST API framework. Do not make guesses, if you find a function, class, class method, or object that looks a lot like an API implementation, but the path is not explicitly defined in this file (perhaps in another file), do not include it in your output. You also need to provide an explanation of your results."

The path is taken from the literal 'dashboard' and represented as /dashboard. It is not a prefix and is not derived from a RESTful naming convention.\n- Route::resource(...) entries define RESTful resource controllers. I treated each resource as a single API entry with the resource path as a prefix (e.g., /posts, /users, /comments, /media). The actual RESTful endpoints (index, show, create, store, edit, update, destroy) are derived from Laravel’s resource routing conventions and are not individually listed here because their exact sub-paths are not explicit literals in this file.\n- The explicit delete route for a post thumbnail (DELETE /posts/{post}/thumbnail) is listed as a separate API entry with its method implied by the route definition and its handler as [PostThumbnailController::class, 'destroy'].\n- All resource-related entries are marked as RESTful and with path prefixes, since they come from Laravel’s resource routing convention. The presence of the implementation files (e.g., PostController, UserController) is outside this routes file, so inSameFile is false for all entries.\n- None of the routes appear to be for testing.\n\nIf you’d like, I can expand the RESTful resource entries into individual endpoint entries (e.g., /posts for GET, /posts/{post} for GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, /posts/{post}/edit for GET, etc.), but that would require assuming the exact HTTP methods for each sub-path based on Laravel’s resource conventions.",
