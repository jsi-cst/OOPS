        "content": "Here’s what the code defines for the UserController and what that means for the HTTP endpoints and methods.\n\nWhat is the full path (with prefix) for UserController endpoints\n- API routes are defined under the api group with a v1 prefix. The effective base path is:\n  - /api/v1\n\nUserController endpoints and their HTTP methods\n- GET /api/v1/users\n  - Action: index\n  - Method(s): GET\n- GET /api/v1/users/{user}\n  - Action: show\n  - Method(s): GET\n- PUT /api/v1/users/{user}\n  - Action: update\n  - Method(s): PUT\n- PATCH /api/v1/users/{user}\n  - Action: update\n  - Method(s): PATCH\n\nNotes:\n- The UserController is wired via two Route::apiResource declarations:\n  - Outside the auth middleware: only index and show are defined (GET for both).\n  - Inside the auth middleware: only update is defined (PUT and PATCH for the single resource).\n\nMethods that are acceptable based on the code\n- GET: Acceptable (via index and show)\n- PUT: Acceptable (via update)\n- PATCH: Acceptable (via update)\n\nMethods that are not defined by the code (and thus not acceptable for this controller)\n- POST: Not defined for UserController (no create/store route)\n- DELETE: Not defined for UserController (no destroy route)\n- HEAD: Not explicitly defined in the code. While many servers/frameworks will handle HEAD for GET routes, there is no explicit HEAD handling in the code you provided.\n- OPTIONS: Not defined in the code\n- TRACE: Not defined in the code\n\nSummary explanation\n- The only operations exposed for UserController are listing users (GET /api/v1/users), showing a single user (GET /api/v1/users/{user}), and updating a user (PUT /api/v1/users/{user} and PATCH /api/v1/users/{user}).\n- This is driven entirely by the routes/api.php definitions using apiResource with specific ->only() constraints: index, show (GET) and update (PUT/PATCH).\n- There are no routes for creating (POST), deleting (DELETE), or other HTTP methods for this controller, and HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE are not explicitly configured in the code (HEAD is not defined by a route here, though some frameworks may handle HEAD automatically for GET routes; that behavior is not shown in the code you provided)."
