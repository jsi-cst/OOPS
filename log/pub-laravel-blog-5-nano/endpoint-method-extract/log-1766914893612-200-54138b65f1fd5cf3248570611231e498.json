        "content": "Here is the determination based on the provided routes and controller code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /v1/posts/{post}\n  - Reason: The PostController@update endpoint is registered under the v1 API prefix and the posts resource. The path for updating a single post is the standard RESTful path /v1/posts/{post}.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: No\n  - Reason: The route set defines only specific methods for this endpoint (PUT/PATCH for update, and other methods exist only for other actions on the same resource path). Not every HTTP method is implemented for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD: Yes\n  - Reason: There is a GET route for the same resource path (/v1/posts/{post}) defined elsewhere (show), so HEAD is effectively available by virtue of the GET route. Laravel typically supports HEAD for routes that have a corresponding GET route.\n\n- POST: No\n  - Reason: There is no POST /v1/posts/{post} route defined. POST is defined for /v1/posts (create) but not for the specific {post} resource path.\n\n- OPTIONS: Yes\n  - Reason: Laravel handles OPTIONS requests for defined routes (preflight/CORS style), so OPTIONS is acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reason: There is no TRACE route defined for this endpoint, and the code does not provide TRACE support.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Reason: There is a GET route for /v1/posts/{post} defined by the public (non-auth) show method of the resource, so GET is acceptable for this path.\n\n- PUT: Yes\n  - Reason: The update method is registered via apiResource('posts', ...)->only(['update', 'store', 'destroy']), which maps update to PUT (and PATCH).\n\n- DELETE: Yes\n  - Reason: The destroy method is registered in the same resource, mapping to DELETE for /v1/posts/{post} (though behind the auth middleware, it is defined).\n\n- PATCH: Yes\n  - Reason: The update method supports PATCH as part of the RESTful resource routing.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint in question is /v1/posts/{post} derived from the v1 API prefix and the posts resource.\n- The update action is defined in the API routes with the posts resource limited to update/store/destroy, which corresponds to PUT and PATCH.\n- There are separate routes for GET (show) and DELETE (destroy) on the same path, hence GET and DELETE are acceptable as well (though DELETE requires authentication as per the middleware group).\n- OPTIONS and HEAD behavior are inferred from standard Laravel routing behavior: OPTIONS is handled for defined routes, HEAD is supported if there is a GET route for the same path.\n- POST on /v1/posts/{post} is not defined, and TRACE is not defined in the code."
