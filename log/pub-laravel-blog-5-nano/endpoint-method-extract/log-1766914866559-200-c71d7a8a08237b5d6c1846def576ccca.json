There are no route parameters for this endpoint, and it is not prefixed (outside of any /settings or other prefixes).\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: Only the store action is defined (POST). No other HTTP methods are registered for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: The code defines only a POST route for this resource. There is no explicit or implicit handling for HEAD in the given code.\n\n- POST acceptable: true\n  - Reasoning: The store method is defined via Route::resource(...)->only('store'), which creates a POST route to /newsletter-subscriptions mapped to NewsletterSubscriptionController@store.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: There is no explicit handling of OPTIONS in the code, and only POST is registered for this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: Not defined in the code; only POST is registered.\n\n- GET acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: GET is not defined for this endpoint; only POST is registered.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: PUT is not defined for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: DELETE is not defined for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Reasoning: PATCH is not defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint is registered as a resource controller with only the store action, which corresponds to a POST request to /newsletter-subscriptions.\n- The route is placed inside a middleware group requiring auth and verified, meaning access is restricted to authenticated and verified users, but this does not expand the allowed HTTP methods beyond POST.\n- There are no other routes or method definitions for this resource in the provided code, so all other HTTP methods are not acceptable for this endpoint."
