        "content": "Here is the analysis for the MediaController@store endpoint based on the provided routes and controller code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /v1/media\n  - Rationale: The store action is registered via Route::apiResource('media', MediaController::class)->only(['store', 'destroy']); inside the v1 API prefix. The store method corresponds to POST /v1/media. There are no path parameters for this action.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: Only the store method (POST) is defined for this endpoint. Other HTTP methods are not implemented for this route.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: The code only defines the store method (POST). HEAD is not defined for this route. In typical frameworks, HEAD for a POST route is not automatically treated as allowed unless GET is defined; based on the code, it's not.\n\n- POST acceptable: True\n  - Rationale: The store method is explicitly implemented and wired to handle POST requests for /v1/media.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: There is no explicit OPTIONS route defined for this endpoint. In this codebase, the route is not showing an OPTIONS handler for store; thus treated as not acceptable by code.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: Not defined in code for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: The GET method is not implemented for this route; only POST is defined via store.\n\n- PUT acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: Not implemented for this route; only POST is defined.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: The destroy method handles DELETE, but that is for the /v1/media/{medium} route, not the store route. The specific store endpoint does not accept DELETE.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: False\n  - Rationale: Not implemented for this route.\n\nExplanation:\n- The routes/api.php file registers a resource route for media with only the store and destroy actions inside the authenticated group, i.e., POST /v1/media (store) and DELETE /v1/media/{medium} (destroy).\n- The MediaController@store method handles creation (store) and uses a MediaLibraryRequest, authorization check, and returns a MediaResource, confirming POST is the only implemented method for this endpoint.\n- Therefore, the requested endpoint (/v1/media) accepts only POST, and no other HTTP methods (including HEAD, OPTIONS, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are defined for this particular endpoint."
