        "content": "Analysis results for the endpoint App\\Http\\Controllers\\UserController@edit\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /settings/account\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint? No.\n  - This endpoint is defined only for GET via Route::get('account', [UserController::class, 'edit']). The same URL path also has a PUT/PATCH route for updating (Route::match(['put','patch'], 'account', ...)), but that is a separate action (not the edit method). Therefore not all methods are acceptable for the edit endpoint.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable? Yes.\n  - In Laravel, HEAD requests are automatically handled for GET routes. Since this endpoint is defined with GET, HEAD requests are treated as acceptable by the framework for this route.\n\n- Is POST acceptable? No.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No.\n  - The code defines no OPTIONS route for this endpoint. There is no explicit OPTIONS handling in the route definitions for edit.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No.\n\n- Is GET acceptable? Yes.\n  - The endpoint is defined with Route::get('account', [UserController::class, 'edit']).\n\n- Is PUT acceptable? No.\n  - PUT is used for the update action on the same path, but not for the edit action. For this endpoint (edit), PUT is not defined here.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable? No.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable? No.\n\nAdditional context:\n- The route is inside the middleware group Route::middleware(['auth','verified'])->group(...), and further inside Route::prefix('settings')->group(...). This means the edit endpoint requires authentication and email verification, i.e., you must be logged in and verified to access GET /settings/account.\n\nExplanation:\n- The edit method is explicitly wired to GET /settings/account. There is a separate PUT/PATCH route on the same path for updating the user, but that corresponds to a different action (update), not to edit. Therefore, the only method for App\\Http\\Controllers\\UserController@edit is GET (with HEAD implicitly supported by Laravel). Other HTTP methods are not defined for this specific endpoint in the provided code."
