        "content": "Here’s what the code defines for the PostCommentController@store endpoint and related routes, along with the resulting HTTP method support and path.\n\n1) Full HTTP request path\n- /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments\n  - Reasoning: The routes/api.php registers a nested resource Route::apiResource('posts.comments', PostCommentController::class) for store inside the v1 API group, which yields POST /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments. The {post} is a route-model bound parameter for the Post being commented on. The overall API prefix /api comes from the RouteServiceProvider, and v1 is added by Route::prefix('v1')->group(...).\n\n2) Are all HTTP methods acceptable?\n- No. The endpoint is defined for specific methods via two route registrations:\n  - POST /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments -> PostCommentController@store (inside an auth/verification middleware group)\n  - GET /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments -> PostCommentController@index (defined in a separate block)\n- Therefore, only GET and POST are acceptable for this path; other methods are not defined for this endpoint.\n\n3) Is HEAD acceptable?\n- Yes, effectively. Since GET /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments is defined (via the index method) for the same path, the framework will typically respond to HEAD requests as well. This is a framework behavior (HEAD handling for GET routes) rather than an explicit route registration, but it means HEAD is acceptable for this path because GET is defined.\n\n4) Is POST acceptable?\n- Yes. POST is explicitly defined via Route::apiResource(...)->only('store') inside the authenticated/verified block, mapping to PostCommentController@store.\n\n5) Is OPTIONS acceptable?\n- Not explicitly. There is no explicit OPTIONS route registered for this path in the code. Unless the framework (or a CORS middleware) provides automatic OPTIONS handling, this is not defined by the code.\n\n6) Is TRACE acceptable?\n- No. There is no TRACE route defined for this path in the code.\n\n7) Is GET acceptable?\n- Yes. GET is defined for this path via Route::apiResource('posts.comments', PostCommentController::class)->only('index'), defined outside the auth group.\n\n8) Is PUT acceptable?\n- No. PUT is not defined for this path in the code (only GET and POST are defined for these nested comments routes).\n\n9) Is DELETE acceptable?\n- No. DELETE is not defined for this path in the code (only GET and POST are defined).\n\n10) Is PATCH acceptable?\n- No. PATCH is not defined for this path in the code.\n\nSummary/explanation:\n- The PostCommentController@store endpoint lives at /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments and uses POST. It is protected by the auth:sanctum and verified middleware, so only authenticated and verified users can create a comment on a post.\n- The same path also has a GET route for listing comments: GET /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments, which maps to PostCommentController@index and is defined outside the authenticated block (likely publicly accessible).\n- Therefore, for the specific endpoint /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments:\n  - GET: acceptable (via index)\n  - POST: acceptable (via store)\n  - HEAD: acceptable in practice (via the GET route), though not explicit in the code\n  - Other methods (PUT, PATCH, DELETE, TRACE, OPTIONS): not defined by the code for this path (Options may be handled by framework/CORS middleware, but not explicitly defined in routes)\n\nIf you need an OpenAPI spec snippet, this would translate to:\n- Path: /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments\n- Methods:\n  - GET: summary “List comments for a post”\n  - POST: summary “Create a comment for a post” (requires authentication/verified)\n- Path parameter: post (integer or string, depending on Post key type)\n- Request body for POST: content, etc. as defined by CommentsRequest in the controller\n- Responses: 200 with CommentResource (for GET and POST), plus appropriate error responses (e.g., 401/403 for auth, 404 for post not found, etc.)"
