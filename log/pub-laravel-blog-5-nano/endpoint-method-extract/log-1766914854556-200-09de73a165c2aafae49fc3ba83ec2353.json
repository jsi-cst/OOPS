        "content": "Here is what the backend defines for the User resource in the Admin area, based on the provided files.\n\nWhat endpoints exist for User (from Route::resource with only index, edit, update)\n- The resource is registered as Route::resource('users', UserController::class)->only(['index', 'edit', 'update']);\n- The admin routes are placed in routes/admin.php and (by convention in Laravel projects) are loaded under the /admin prefix and the Admin namespace.\n\nTherefore, the full HTTP request paths (with the common admin prefix) and their HTTP methods are:\n\n- List users (index)\n  - GET /admin/users\n- Show edit form for a user (edit)\n  - GET /admin/users/{user}/edit\n- Update a user (update)\n  - PUT /admin/users/{user}\n  - PATCH /admin/users/{user}\n\nNotes:\n- {user} is a route parameter representing a User model instance (implicit via route-model binding).\n- POST, DELETE, etc. are not defined for this resource (they are not included in the only([...]) list).\n\nSummary of method support across the defined endpoints\n- HEAD\n  - Yes for the GET-based endpoints (GET /admin/users and GET /admin/users/{user}/edit) because Laravel handles HEAD requests for GET routes automatically.\n  - Not directly defined for the PUT/PATCH route (update) by the code; HEAD for that path is not a defined method in the routes, though some servers may answer HEAD for other methods. In strict terms, HEAD is implicitly available only where GET is defined.\n- POST\n  - No (not defined in routes for users).\n- OPTIONS\n  - No (not explicitly defined; Laravel does not create an OPTIONS endpoint for this resource by default in the provided code).\n- TRACE\n  - No (not defined anywhere).\n- GET\n  - Yes (two GET routes exist: /admin/users and /admin/users/{user}/edit).\n- PUT\n  - Yes (the update action is defined via PUT /admin/users/{user}).\n- DELETE\n  - No (not defined for this resource).\n- PATCH\n  - Yes (the update action is also defined via PATCH /admin/users/{user}).\n\nExplanation\n- The UserController defines three actions relevant to routes: index (GET), edit (GET), and update (PUT/PATCH).\n- The routes file uses Route::resource with only(['index', 'edit', 'update']), which means only the following routes are created: GET /admin/users, GET /admin/users/{user}/edit, PUT/PATCH /admin/users/{user}.\n- The common admin URL prefix is inferred from the presence of other admin routes (dashboard, posts, etc.) and the fact that these controllers live under App\\Http\\Controllers\\Admin. In typical Laravel setups, routes/admin.php is loaded with a prefix of /admin and a namespace of App\\Http\\Controllers\\Admin, yielding the full paths shown above.\n- There is no POST, DELETE on /admin/users, nor a dedicated OPTIONS/TRACE route defined in the code. Head requests are not explicitly defined in the code, but Laravel treats HEAD as equivalent to GET for GET routes, so HEAD is effectively acceptable for the GET endpoints.\n\nIf you want me to tailor these results to a different route-loading setup (e.g., if /admin is not the actual prefix), share how routes/admin.php is loaded (prefix, namespace) and I’ll adjust the full paths accordingly."
