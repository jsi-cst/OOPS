I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/UserCommentController.php`, I found that `App\\Http\\Controllers\\Api\\V1\\UserCommentController@index` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "- Full HTTP request path: /api/v1/users/{user}/comments\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable? No. The route is registered with only the index method for this nested resource:\n  - Route: Route::apiResource('users.comments', UserCommentController::class)->only('index');\n  - This defines only GET for this endpoint. No other methods are registered for this path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? Yes (explanation below). Although HEAD is not explicitly defined in the routes, Laravel handles HEAD requests automatically for routes that have a GET method. Since this endpoint provides a GET (index) action, HEAD requests will be handled by the framework as per standard behavior.\n\n- GET acceptable? Yes. The index method of UserCommentController handles the request (returns a paginated collection of comments for the user).\n\n- POST acceptable? No. Not registered (only index is defined for this endpoint).\n\n- PUT acceptable? No. Not registered.\n\n- PATCH acceptable? No. Not registered.\n\n- DELETE acceptable? No. Not registered.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No explicit OPTIONS route defined. Without an explicit route, framework-level handling for OPTIONS is not guaranteed by the code alone (it may be handled by the framework/server in practice, but the code does not define an OPTIONS method). So, based strictly on the code, not explicitly defined.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint comes from a nested resource route: users.comments with only('index'), which maps to the GET /api/v1/users/{user}/comments path (the v1 prefix is applied in the top-level group).\n- The UserCommentController@index method returns a paginated collection of the user’s comments, confirming that GET is the supported method.\n- The route for this endpoint is outside the auth middleware group, meaning it does not require authentication by default (as defined in routes/api.php). This is an additional contextual detail about access, not the HTTP method support.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable because Laravel automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that have a GET method, even though HEAD is not explicitly defined in the code.\n- All other standard methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS) are not registered for this endpoint, so they are not acceptable according to the code.",
