No\n  Explanation: The route is defined with only PUT and PATCH methods for updating the password.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? No\n  Explanation: There is no HEAD route defined for /settings/password. HEAD is not automatically assumed for non-GET routes based on the code.\n\n- POST acceptable? No\n  Explanation: The route for updating passwords uses PUT and PATCH only; POST is not defined for this path.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? No\n  Explanation: There is no explicit OPTIONS route for this path in the code. Only PUT and PATCH are defined, so OPTIONS is not supported by the route as coded.\n\n- TRACE acceptable? No\n  Explanation: TRACE is not defined in the route; only PUT and PATCH are defined for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable? No\n  Explanation: This path does not define a GET route; only update via PUT/PATCH is provided.\n\n- PUT acceptable? Yes\n  Explanation: The routes/auth.php defines match(['put','patch'], 'password', [UserPasswordController::class, 'update']).\n\n- DELETE acceptable? No\n  Explanation: There is no DELETE route defined for this path.\n\n- PATCH acceptable? Yes\n  Explanation: The routes/auth.php defines match(['put','patch'], 'password', [UserPasswordController::class, 'update']).\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint for updating the user password is defined under the authenticated and verified group with the prefix settings, at the path /settings/password.\n- It accepts only PUT and PATCH requests, routed to UserPasswordController@update.\n- No other HTTP methods (HEAD, GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE) are configured for this endpoint in the provided code."
