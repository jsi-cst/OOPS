I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php`, I found that `PostController::class` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

There is no indication that all methods are accepted.\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - The route is defined for GET, and in Laravel (the framework used by this project), HEAD requests to GET routes are generally handled automatically by the framework (returning the same headers as GET, with an empty body). There is no explicit HEAD route defined, but HEAD is supported for GET routes by the framework.\n\n- POST: false\n  - The endpoint is not registered for POST (only GET for show).\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - While not explicitly defined in code, Laravel’s routing layer typically responds to OPTIONS requests for routes to indicate allowed methods. Since the endpoint supports GET, an OPTIONS request is typically answered with the appropriate Allow header. This is a framework-level behavior, not an explicit route, but it applies here.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - There is no TRACE handling defined or implied by the code. TRACE is not exposed by the defined routes.\n\n- GET: true\n  - The endpoint is defined as the show action of a resource route, which is a GET route: /posts/{post}.\n\n- PUT: false\n  - Not registered for PUT for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - Not registered for DELETE for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH: false\n  - Not registered for PATCH for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation\n\n- The only PostController route defined in web.php for the PostController is the resource route limited to 'show'. This yields a single GET endpoint: GET /posts/{post}. The controller method show handles obtaining the Post via route-model binding and returns a view; there is no code indicating support for other HTTP methods for this endpoint.\n- HEAD is not explicitly declared in code but is implicitly supported by Laravel for GET routes, so HEAD is considered acceptable.\n- OPTIONS is not explicit in code either, but Laravel responds to OPTIONS for routes to advertise allowed methods, so it is considered acceptable for this endpoint.\n- All-methods is false because only GET is defined for this endpoint.\n- Other verbs (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are false because there is no route/action defined for them for this endpoint.",
