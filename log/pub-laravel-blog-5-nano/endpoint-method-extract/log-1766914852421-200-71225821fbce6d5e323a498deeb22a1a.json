Laravel will not treat HEAD as acceptable unless it is explicitly defined (and it is not here).\n\n- POST: False\n  - POST is not declared as an accepted method for this route.\n\n- OPTIONS: False\n  - OPTIONS is not declared as an accepted method for this route.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - TRACE is not declared as an accepted method for this route.\n\n- GET: False\n  - GET is not declared as an accepted method for this route.\n\n- PUT: True\n  - PUT is declared as an accepted method in Route::match(['put','patch'], 'account', ...).\n\n- DELETE: False\n  - DELETE is not declared as an accepted method for this route.\n\n- PATCH: True\n  - PATCH is declared as an accepted method in Route::match(['put','patch'], 'account', ...).\n\nExplanation:\n- The update method is registered under the settings prefix as part of an authenticated and verified user group:\n  Route::prefix('settings')->group(function () {\n      Route::match(['put', 'patch'], 'account', [UserController::class, 'update'])->name('users.update');\n  });\n- This means the endpoint path is /settings/account and only HTTP methods PUT and PATCH are handled by this route.\n- HEAD, POST, GET, DELETE, OPTIONS, and TRACE are not supported by this route according to the code, so they are not acceptable for this endpoint. The HEAD handling for non-GET routes is not defined in this route."
