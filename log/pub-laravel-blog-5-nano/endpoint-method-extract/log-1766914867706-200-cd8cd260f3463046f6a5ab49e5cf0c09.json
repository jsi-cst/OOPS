The store action is POST, and there is a separate DELETE route for the same path (destroy). There is no implication that all methods are acceptable for the store action.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - The code (a POST route for this path) does not indicate any HEAD handling. In Laravel, HEAD is typically tied to GET routes; there is no GET route here for this path, so HEAD is not explicitly acceptable.\n\n- POST acceptable: true\n  - The PostLikeController@store method handles POST requests to /posts/{post}/likes, per routes/auth.php.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS route defined for this path in the provided files. Without an explicit route, and based on the code, OPTIONS is not indicated as acceptable.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - No TRACE handling is defined in the code.\n\n- GET acceptable: false\n  - There is no GET route for /posts/{post}/likes in the provided routes, and the store method is POST.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - No PUT route for this path is defined in the provided files.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false (for the store endpoint)\n  - While there is a DELETE route for /posts/{post}/likes (mapped to PostLikeController@destroy) in routes/auth.php, that represents a separate action (destroy) on the same resource. The store endpoint itself is only defined for POST; thus DELETE is not acceptable for the store endpoint.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - No PATCH route for this path is defined in the provided files.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint you’re focusing on is the store action of PostLikeController, which is wired to POST /posts/{post}/likes in routes/auth.php.\n- There is also a separate DELETE route for the same path that points to a different controller action (destroy). That means the path supports multiple methods, but each method corresponds to a specific action. For the store endpoint (the POST action), only POST is acceptable.\n- HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, PATCH are not defined for this specific endpoint in the given code, so they are not considered acceptable for the store action.\n- The presence of a DELETE route on the same path does not change the fact that the store endpoint’s accepted method is POST; DELETE is a separate endpoint/action."
