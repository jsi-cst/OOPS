Only the index (GET) action is registered.\n\n- POST: No\n  - Reason: Not registered via the route definition (only index is allowed).\n\n- OPTIONS: No\n  - Reason: Not explicitly registered by the code for this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE: No\n  - Reason: Not defined by the code for this endpoint.\n\n- GET: Yes\n  - Reason: The index action is defined and the route registration uses only('index'), which maps to the GET method for listing resources.\n\n- PUT: No\n  - Reason: Not registered by the code for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE: No\n  - Reason: Not registered by the code for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH: No\n  - Reason: Not registered by the code for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation of results:\n- The endpoint is defined via a nested API resource: users.posts mapped to UserPostController, with only the index method allowed. In Laravel, that means the endpoint supports the GET method to list a user’s posts. The path includes the user parameter as {user}, reflecting Laravel's route-model binding for the User model.\n- The route is placed outside the auth:sanctum, verified middleware block, so authentication is not implied by the route itself (though other parts of the API may require authentication for other endpoints). The actual method surface for this endpoint, based on the code, is limited to GET /api/v1/users/{user}/posts.\n- Because only index (GET) is registered, all other HTTP methods are not supported by this route per the code. HEAD is not explicitly defined, so while some frameworks treat HEAD as synonymous with GET, this assessment sticks strictly to the code: HEAD is not explicitly registered, so we mark it as not acceptable based on code alone."
