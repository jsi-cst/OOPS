The {post} is the route model binding parameter.\n\n- Which HTTP methods are defined for this path (based on the routes)\n  - GET /api/v1/posts/{post} -> show (defined outside the auth group)\n  - PUT /api/v1/posts/{post} -> update (defined inside the auth group)\n  - PATCH /api/v1/posts/{post} -> update (same as above)\n  - DELETE /api/v1/posts/{post} -> destroy (the method you asked about, defined inside the auth group)\n  - POST /api/v1/posts/{post} is not defined\n  - HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE are not explicitly defined for this path in the routes file\n\n- Authentication/authorization note\n  - The destroy route is inside a middleware group requiring auth:sanctum and verified, so DELETE /api/v1/posts/{post} requires authentication/verification. The GET show route is outside that group and is publicly accessible.\n\nAnswer to the requested items\n\n- Full HTTP request path (starting with / and using {post}): /api/v1/posts/{post}\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n- Is HEAD acceptable? Not based on the code (no HEAD route defined for this path; GET is defined but HEAD is not explicitly handled)\n- Is POST acceptable? No\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable? No\n- Is TRACE acceptable? No\n- Is GET acceptable? Yes (show route defined for this path)\n- Is PUT acceptable? Yes (update route defined for this path)\n- Is DELETE acceptable? Yes (destroy route defined for this path)\n- Is PATCH acceptable? Yes (update route defined for this path)\n\nExplanation\n\n- The PostController@destroy method is registered via a resource route within the v1 API group, specifically for the path /api/v1/posts/{post} with the DELETE method, and it requires authentication (auth:sanctum, verified).\n- The same path also has GET (show) and PUT/PATCH (update) routes defined elsewhere in the same file, so the path supports multiple methods depending on the HTTP verb.\n- No explicit HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, or POST routes are defined for /api/v1/posts/{post} in the provided routes, so those methods are not considered acceptable based on the code alone."
