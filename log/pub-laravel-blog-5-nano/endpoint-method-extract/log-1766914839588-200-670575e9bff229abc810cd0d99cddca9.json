        "content": "Here is what the backend code defines for the PostController::show endpoint and the resulting HTTP method support.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /posts/{post}\n  - Reasoning: In routes/web.php, the PostController is registered with Route::resource('posts', PostController::class)->only('show');, which creates a GET route to /posts/{post} for the show method. The {post} is the path parameter bound to the Post model.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  - Reasoning: Only the show action is registered for this resource route (GET). There are no routes defined to handle other methods for /posts/{post}.\n\n- HEAD: True\n  - Reasoning: The route is defined with GET (the show method). Laravel automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that respond to GET by returning headers without the body, so HEAD is acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- POST: False\n  - Reasoning: There is no POST route defined for /posts/{post} in the given files (only GET is defined for show).\n\n- OPTIONS: True\n  - Reasoning: Laravel generally handles OPTIONS requests for routes that exist (often returning allowed methods in the response). Since there is a GET route for this endpoint, OPTIONS is typically handled as well.\n\n- TRACE: False\n  - Reasoning: There is no TRACE route defined for this endpoint, and TRACE is not handled by default by the application.\n\n- GET: True\n  - Reasoning: The route is explicitly defined as a GET route for the show method via Route::resource(...)->only('show').\n\n- PUT: False\n  - Reasoning: No PUT route is defined for /posts/{post}.\n\n- DELETE: False\n  - Reasoning: No DELETE route is defined for /posts/{post}.\n\n- PATCH: False\n  - Reasoning: No PATCH route is defined for /posts/{post}.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint is the show action for the posts resource, mapped to GET /posts/{post}.\n- Only GET is explicitly defined for this endpoint, so only GET is guaranteed by the code.\n- HEAD is commonly supported automatically for GET routes in Laravel, so it’s considered acceptable here.\n- OPTIONS is usually handled automatically by Laravel for existing routes.\n- All other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, TRACE) are not defined for this endpoint according to the provided code."
