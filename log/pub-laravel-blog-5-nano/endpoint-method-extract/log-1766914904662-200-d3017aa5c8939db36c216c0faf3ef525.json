        "content": "Here is the analysis for the CommentController@index endpoint based on the provided routes and controller code.\n\n1) Full HTTP request path\n- /api/v1/comments\n- Reason: The routes file defines a top-level API group prefixing with v1 and the application’s API routes are under the /api prefix. The index action of CommentController is registered via:\n  Route::apiResource('comments', CommentController::class)->only(['index','show']);\n  within the /api/v1 group. There is no path parameter for the index route, so the path is /api/v1/comments (no {} parameters).\n\n2) Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No. The index method is mapped only to GET. There is no route for other methods on /api/v1/comments (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc.) for this endpoint.\n\n3) Is HEAD acceptable for this endpoint?\n- Yes. Since there is a GET route for /api/v1/comments (the index method), HEAD requests are typically handled by the framework as a HEAD version of the GET response (no body). The code defines a GET route; HEAD is supported by the framework for that GET route.\n\n4) Is POST acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No. There is no POST route defined for /api/v1/comments (the only route for comments without a path parameter is GET for index; POST is not defined on this endpoint).\n\n5) Is OPTIONS acceptable for this endpoint?\n- Yes. While there is no explicit OPTIONS route defined, most frameworks (including Laravel) respond to OPTIONS for a route by listing the allowed methods. Since GET is defined for /api/v1/comments, an OPTIONS response is typically provided by the framework as part of normal routing behavior.\n\n6) Is TRACE acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No. There is no TRACE handling defined or implied by the code for this endpoint.\n\n7) Is GET acceptable for this endpoint?\n- Yes. The index method is explicitly exposed via GET as part of the apiResource with only(['index','show']).\n\n8) Is PUT acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No. There is no PUT route defined for /api/v1/comments (PUT is not part of the index route’s allowed methods).\n\n9) Is DELETE acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No for the index endpoint. The destroy action for deleting a comment is registered under an authenticated group as:\n  Route::apiResource('comments', CommentController::class)->only('destroy');\n  but that route is /api/v1/comments/{comment} with DELETE and is protected by auth middleware. It is a separate endpoint from index (which is /api/v1/comments with no path parameter). Therefore, DELETE is not acceptable for the index endpoint itself.\n\n10) Is PATCH acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No. There is no PATCH route defined for /api/v1/comments.\n\nExplanation of results:\n- The routes file defines two sets of routes for comments:\n  - Public: GET /api/v1/comments (index) and GET /api/v1/comments/{comment} (show)\n  - Authenticated: DELETE /api/v1/comments/{comment} (destroy)\n  - Additionally, there is a destroy route defined in the authenticated block, but that does not affect the index endpoint’s supported methods.\n- Therefore, for the specific endpoint corresponding to CommentController@index (GET /api/v1/comments), only GET is supported. Other methods (HEAD is supported in practice via the framework as a HEAD version of GET, while POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, and TRACE are not defined for this endpoint). OPTIONS is typically handled automatically by the framework for any defined route, so it is considered acceptable as well."
