The route is defined as GET /settings/password for the edit form.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - The code defines only specific methods for this path: GET for showing the form, and PUT/PATCH for updating. No support for all methods is indicated.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false\n  - There is no explicit HEAD route for this path in the code. The only defined methods for this path are GET (for edit) and PUT/PATCH (for update). Based strictly on the code, HEAD is not shown as acceptable.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - There is no POST route for /settings/password in the code. The update action uses PUT/PATCH, not POST.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - There is no explicit OPTIONS route defined for this path in the code.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - There is no explicit TRACE route defined for this path.\n\n- GET acceptable: true\n  - The route Route::get('password', [UserPasswordController::class, 'edit'])->name('users.password') defines GET /settings/password to show the password edit form.\n\n- PUT acceptable: true\n  - The route Route::match(['put', 'patch'], 'password', [UserPasswordController::class, 'update'])->name('users.password.update') defines PUT /settings/password to update the password.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - There is no DELETE route for /settings/password.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: true\n  - The route Route::match(['put', 'patch'], 'password', [UserPasswordController::class, 'update'])->name('users.password.update') defines PATCH /settings/password to update the password.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint lives under the auth and verified middleware and is scoped to the settings area. The edit method is exposed via GET /settings/password to display the form, while the update method handles PUT or PATCH to actually change the password. There are no other HTTP methods defined for this path in the code, and the redirect for .well-known/change-password points to /settings/password, but does not add any additional methods for this path. Therefore, only GET, PUT, and PATCH are allowed; all other methods are not supported according to the code."
