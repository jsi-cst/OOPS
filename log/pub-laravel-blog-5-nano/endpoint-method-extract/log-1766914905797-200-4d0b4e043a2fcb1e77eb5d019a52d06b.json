        "content": "Here is the analysis for the PostController.index endpoint based on the provided files.\n\n- Full HTTP request path\n  - /v1/posts\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Explanation: The index action is defined only for the GET method on this path via Laravel's resource routing. Other methods are not defined for this specific action (though unrelated routes may exist for other actions on the same resource path).\n\n- HEAD acceptable?\n  - True\n  - Explanation: In Laravel, HEAD requests are automatically supported for routes that have a GET counterpart. Since the index action responds to GET /v1/posts, HEAD /v1/posts is also considered acceptable by the framework.\n\n- POST acceptable?\n  - False (for this endpoint/action)\n  - Explanation: POST to /v1/posts would map to a different action (store) if you consider the same resource path, but that is a separate action defined in the authenticated block as store for creating posts. The index method itself handles only GET.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Explanation: There is no explicit OPTIONS route defined for /v1/posts in the provided routes. Laravel does not require an explicit OPTIONS for each endpoint, but based on the code you provided, there is no OPTIONS route handling described for this endpoint.\n\n- TRACE acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Explanation: No TRACE route is defined in the provided code.\n\n- GET acceptable?\n  - True\n  - Explanation: The index method is explicitly implemented and exposed via Route::apiResource('posts', PostController::class)->only(['index','show']) in routes/api.php, under the v1 prefix. So GET /v1/posts is an action that this endpoint handles.\n\n- PUT acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Explanation: The index endpoint does not handle PUT; PUT is used for update on /v1/posts/{post} in the authenticated routes, not for /v1/posts (index).\n\n- DELETE acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Explanation: The index endpoint does not handle DELETE; DELETE is used for destroy on /v1/posts/{post}, not for /v1/posts (index).\n\n- PATCH acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Explanation: The index endpoint does not handle PATCH; PATCH is used for update on /v1/posts/{post}, not for /v1/posts (index).\n\nExplanation summary\n- The index method (GET /v1/posts) is defined publicly in routes/api.php via an apiResource with only index and show. Thus GET is the primary method for this endpoint.\n- HEAD is typically supported automatically for GET routes in Laravel, so it is considered acceptable for this endpoint.\n- Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) correspond to other actions (store, update, destroy) on this resource, but not to the index action itself. Since the question focuses on the index endpoint, those methods are not applicable to /v1/posts/index.\n- OPTIONS and TRACE are not defined for this endpoint in the provided code.\n\nIf you want this expressed in a formal OpenAPI-like summary, the key endpoint would be:\n- Path: /v1/posts\n- Methods: GET (index), HEAD (implicit for GET)\n- Other methods: not defined for this action (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE/OPTIONS/TRACE not applicable to the index action in the provided code)"
