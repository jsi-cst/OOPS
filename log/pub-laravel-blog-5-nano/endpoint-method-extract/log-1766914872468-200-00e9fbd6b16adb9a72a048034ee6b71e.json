        "content": "Here is the determined OpenAPI-friendly endpoint information based on the provided route and controller code.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments\n  - Explanation: The PostCommentController@store is registered via Route::apiResource('posts.comments', PostCommentController::class)->only('store') inside the v1 API group. The nested resource posts.comments yields the path posts/{post}/comments. With the API prefix and v1 group, the full path becomes /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments. The {post} is a route-model binding for a Post.\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable? No\n  - Explanation: The route definition uses only('store'), which means only the store method is registered for this endpoint. No other HTTP methods are registered for this specific route.\n\n- HEAD: Not acceptable\n  - Explanation: There is no HEAD route defined for /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments (only POST is defined via store). Laravel does not automatically map HEAD to POST unless a GET route exists, so HEAD is not acceptable here based on the code.\n\n- POST: Acceptable\n  - Explanation: The store method is defined for this endpoint via only('store') on the nested resource, so POST is valid and will execute PostCommentController@store.\n\n- OPTIONS: Not acceptable\n  - Explanation: There is no OPTIONS route defined for this endpoint in the provided code. OPTIONS would only be valid if explicitly supported or automatically handled by the framework for this route; based on the code, it is not defined.\n\n- TRACE: Not acceptable\n  - Explanation: No TRACE route is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- GET: Not acceptable\n  - Explanation: GET is not registered for this endpoint; index/show for comments are defined on other routes, not this specific nested store route.\n\n- PUT: Not acceptable\n  - Explanation: PUT is not registered for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE: Not acceptable\n  - Explanation: DELETE is not registered for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH: Not acceptable\n  - Explanation: PATCH is not registered for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint in question is the POST action for the nested resource posts.comments, registered only for store(), under the v1 API group with authentication middleware. Therefore, the only valid HTTP method for this exact route is POST, and the path is /api/v1/posts/{post}/comments. All other methods (HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, GET, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are not defined for this specific route in the provided code. Authentication is required due to the auth:sanctum and verified middleware in the group."
