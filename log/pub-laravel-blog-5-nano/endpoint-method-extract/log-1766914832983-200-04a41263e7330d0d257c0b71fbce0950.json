I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/PostThumbnailController.php`, I found that `[PostThumbnailController::class, 'destroy']` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

The admin route group (inferred from the file name and the redirect to admin.posts.edit) typically prefixes all routes with /admin, yielding the full path /admin/posts/{post}/thumbnail.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: False\n  - Explanation: The route is defined with Route::delete, so only DELETE is defined for this endpoint. No wildcard or match/any is used.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: False\n- POST acceptable: False\n- OPTIONS acceptable: False\n- TRACE acceptable: False\n- GET acceptable: False\n- PUT acceptable: False\n- DELETE acceptable: True\n- PATCH acceptable: False\n\nExplanation summary:\n- The endpoint is registered as a DELETE route for /admin/posts/{post}/thumbnail, so only the DELETE method is supported by the code. Other methods are not defined for this endpoint. HEAD is not automatically allowed for a non-GET route based on the given code, and there is no evidence of any route definitions that would enable the other methods. The redirect in the controller confirms an admin-namespaced route structure (admin.posts.*), reinforcing the /admin prefix in the full path.",
