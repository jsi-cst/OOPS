        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint that maps to App\\Http\\Controllers\\Api\\V1\\UserController@show.\n\n- Full HTTP request path\n  - /api/v1/users/{user}\n\n- Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n  - No.\n  - Reason: The route for show is defined as part of an API resource with only index and show in the public (non-authenticated) block: Route::apiResource('users', UserController::class)->only(['index','show']); This endpoint handles GET (show). There is a separate update route for the same path within the authenticated block (PUT/PATCH for update), so not all methods are intended for this endpoint in isolation.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Reason: HEAD requests to GET routes are generally handled by Laravel automatically, so since show is a GET route, HEAD is considered acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- Is POST acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Reason: There is no POST route defined for /api/v1/users/{user} mapping to show. POST is not part of this endpoint’s accepted methods.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS route defined for this endpoint in the code. Without framework-level CORS/OPTIONS handling to rely on (which would be outside the app’s explicit routes), OPTIONS is not defined here.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Reason: No TRACE route is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- Is GET acceptable?\n  - Yes.\n  - Reason: This is the primary method mapped to show: Route::apiResource(...)->only(['index','show']) includes the GET method for /api/v1/users/{user}.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Reason:PUT would map to the update action, which is defined in a separate, authenticated group for the same resource path. For the show endpoint specifically, PUT is not the intended method.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Reason: There is no DELETE route for the show endpoint; delete exists for the resource in other contexts, but not for the show action on this path.\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable?\n  - No.\n  - Reason: PATCH would map to the update action, which is defined elsewhere (in the authenticated group). For the show endpoint specifically, PATCH is not the intended method.\n\nExplanation\n- The endpoint you’re asking about is the show action of a users resource:\n  - Path: /api/v1/users/{user}\n  - HTTP method: GET\n- The routes file defines this endpoint in the non-authenticated block with a GET route for show via apiResource('users', UserController::class)->only(['index','show']).\n- There is a separate authenticated route for the same resource path that handles update (PUT/PATCH), so while the path supports multiple methods in the overall route set, the show endpoint itself only handles GET (with HEAD being implicitly supported by Laravel for GET routes).\n- Therefore, the only methods effectively acceptable for the show endpoint are GET (and HEAD as a by-product). All other methods are not defined for this specific endpoint."
