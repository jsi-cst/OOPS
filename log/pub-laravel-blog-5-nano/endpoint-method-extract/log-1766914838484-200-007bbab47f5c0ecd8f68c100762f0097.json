There is no configuration indicating that all methods are acceptable for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: false (based strictly on the code)\n  - Reason: There is no explicit HEAD route for the show action in the code. The code defines only the GET-based show action. If you strictly follow the code, HEAD is not declared as acceptable. Note: In Laravel, HEAD requests are typically handled automatically for GET routes at runtime, but that is framework behavior not shown in the code provided.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - Reason: The show endpoint is not defined for POST in the public API routes (only index and show are defined for GET; create/store for POST are defined in the authenticated group for different endpoints).\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No OPTIONS route is defined for this endpoint in the code.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No TRACE route is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable: true\n  - Reason: The show action is exposed via the API resource with only 'index' and 'show' allowed, and the show method in PostController is implemented to return the resource.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Reason: Not defined for this endpoint (update is defined only in the authenticated group, not for show).\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - Reason: Not defined for this endpoint (destroy is defined only in the authenticated group, not for show).\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Reason: Not defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation summary\n- The endpoint that maps to PostController@show is the public GET route /api/v1/posts/{post}, defined in routes/api.php via apiResource('posts', PostController::class)->only(['index', 'show']).\n- The codebase also defines other methods (update, store, destroy) for the same resource but only in a separate authenticated group, and these do not include 'show'. Therefore, per code, only GET is explicitly exposed for the show action.\n- HEAD is not explicitly declared in the code for this endpoint. While Laravel typically handles HEAD automatically for GET routes at runtime, that behavior is framework-level and not shown in the provided code, so we mark HEAD as not acceptable based strictly on the code. The GET method is explicitly implemented and available."
