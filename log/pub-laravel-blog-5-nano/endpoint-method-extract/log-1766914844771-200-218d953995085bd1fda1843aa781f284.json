I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/UserController.php`, I found that `UserController::class` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

          "content": "Here is what the backend defines for the User resource in the Admin area, based on the provided files.\n\nWhat endpoints exist for User (from Route::resource with only index, edit, update)\n- The resource is registered as Route::resource('users', UserController::class)->only(['index', 'edit', 'update']);\n- The admin routes are placed in routes/admin.php and (by convention in Laravel projects) are loaded under the /admin prefix and the Admin namespace.\n\nTherefore, the full HTTP request paths (with the common admin prefix) and their HTTP methods are:\n\n- List users (index)\n  - GET /admin/users\n- Show edit form for a user (edit)\n  - GET /admin/users/{user}/edit\n- Update a user (update)\n  - PUT /admin/users/{user}\n  - PATCH /admin/users/{user}\n\nNotes:\n- {user} is a route parameter representing a User model instance (implicit via route-model binding).\n- POST, DELETE, etc. are not defined for this resource (they are not included in the only([...]) list).\n\nSummary of method support across the defined endpoints\n- HEAD\n  - Yes for the GET-based endpoints (GET /admin/users and GET /admin/users/{user}/edit) because Laravel handles HEAD requests for GET routes automatically.\n  - Not directly defined for the PUT/PATCH route (update) by the code; HEAD for that path is not a defined method in the routes, though some servers may answer HEAD for other methods. In strict terms, HEAD is implicitly available only where GET is defined.\n- POST\n  - No (not defined in routes for users).\n- OPTIONS\n  - No (not explicitly defined; Laravel does not create an OPTIONS endpoint for this resource by default in the provided code).\n- TRACE\n  - No (not defined anywhere).\n- GET\n  - Yes (two GET routes exist: /admin/users and /admin/users/{user}/edit).\n- PUT\n  - Yes (the update action is defined via PUT /admin/users/{user}).\n- DELETE\n  - No (not defined for this resource).\n- PATCH\n  - Yes (the update action is also defined via PATCH /admin/users/{user}).\n\nExplanation\n- The UserController defines three actions relevant to routes: index (GET), edit (GET), and update (PUT/PATCH).\n- The routes file uses Route::resource with only(['index', 'edit', 'update']), which means only the following routes are created: GET /admin/users, GET /admin/users/{user}/edit, PUT/PATCH /admin/users/{user}.\n- The common admin URL prefix is inferred from the presence of other admin routes (dashboard, posts, etc.) and the fact that these controllers live under App\\Http\\Controllers\\Admin. In typical Laravel setups, routes/admin.php is loaded with a prefix of /admin and a namespace of App\\Http\\Controllers\\Admin, yielding the full paths shown above.\n- There is no POST, DELETE on /admin/users, nor a dedicated OPTIONS/TRACE route defined in the code. Head requests are not explicitly defined in the code, but Laravel treats HEAD as equivalent to GET for GET routes, so HEAD is effectively acceptable for the GET endpoints.\n\nIf you want me to tailor these results to a different route-loading setup (e.g., if /admin is not the actual prefix), share how routes/admin.php is loaded (prefix, namespace) and I’ll adjust the full paths accordingly.",
