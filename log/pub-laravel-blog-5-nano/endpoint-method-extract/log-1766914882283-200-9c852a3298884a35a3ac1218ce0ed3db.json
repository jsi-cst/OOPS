        "content": "Here are the findings based on the provided routes and controller:\n\n- Full HTTP request path\n  - /api/v1/posts/{post}/likes\n  - Reasoning: The route is defined as POST /posts/{post}/likes and DELETE /posts/{post}/likes inside a prefix of v1, which itself is under the API prefix (Laravel’s api routes are typically served under /api). The {post} is a route parameter used for model binding.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reasoning: Only specific methods are defined for this endpoint (POST for store and DELETE for destroy). There is no catch-all or Route::any configuration here, so not all methods are acceptable.\n\n- HEAD acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reasoning: There is no explicit HEAD route defined for this endpoint in the code. The controller defines only store (POST) and destroy (DELETE) methods for this path.\n\n- POST acceptable?\n  - True\n  - Reasoning: The routes include Route::post('/posts/{post}/likes', [PostLikeController::class, 'store']) inside the authenticated group, and the controller implements store().\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reasoning: There is no explicit OPTIONS route defined for this path in the code. The code does not indicate handling OPTIONS; thus per code alone, OPTIONS is not defined.\n\n- TRACE acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reasoning: No TRACE route or handling is defined in the code.\n\n- GET acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reasoning: There is no GET route for this path; only POST (store) and DELETE (destroy) are defined for this endpoint.\n\n- PUT acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reasoning: No PUT route is defined for this path.\n\n- DELETE acceptable?\n  - True\n  - Reasoning: The route DELETE /posts/{post}/likes is defined and mapped to PostLikeController@destroy, and the controller implements destroy().\n\n- PATCH acceptable?\n  - False\n  - Reasoning: No PATCH route is defined for this path.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question is the destroy method of PostLikeController, which is wired via the DELETE route /api/v1/posts/{post}/likes (under the v1 API prefix and authenticated group). The controller’s destroy method calls $post->dislike(), so DELETE is the only method supported by this controller action.\n- The POST method is supported for the corresponding store action (not the destroy action), as shown by the separate POST route for the same path, but the destroy endpoint itself only handles DELETE.\n- HEAD/OPTIONS/TRACE/GET/PUT/PATCH are not defined for this specific endpoint in the given code, so they are considered not acceptable based on the code inspection."
