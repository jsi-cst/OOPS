There is also a separate DELETE route for the same path, but that maps to a different controller method (destroy). Therefore not all methods are acceptable for this specific endpoint.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no HEAD route defined for this path, and HEAD would only be implicitly handled if a GET route existed. Since only POST is defined for this endpoint, HEAD is not acceptable based on the code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable for this endpoint?\n  Yes. The PostLikeController@store endpoint is registered as a POST route at /api/v1/posts/{post}/likes.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No explicit OPTIONS route is defined for this endpoint in the code. Therefore, OPTIONS is not considered acceptable based on the code provided.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no TRACE route defined for this endpoint in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no GET route defined for this endpoint; only POST is defined for the store method on this path.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no PUT route defined for this endpoint.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No for the store endpoint. Although there is a DELETE route defined on the same path (/api/v1/posts/{post}/likes) mapped to PostLikeController@destroy, that route does not apply to the store method. Therefore, DELETE is not acceptable for this particular endpoint (store).\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no PATCH route defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation\n\n- The route is defined inside the v1 API group and under the auth:sanctum, verified middleware, indicating authentication is required to access the endpoint.\n- The store action is registered via Route::post('/posts/{post}/likes', PostLikeController@store, ...), so the only supported HTTP method for the store endpoint is POST.\n- There is a separate DELETE route for the same path that targets PostLikeController@destroy, but that is a separate endpoint (same path, different method/view), not an extension of the POST endpoint. For the specific PostLikeController@store endpoint, only POST is valid.\n- No explicit GET/HEAD/OPTIONS/PUT/TRACE/PATCH routes are defined for this particular endpoint, so they are not considered acceptable based on the code."
