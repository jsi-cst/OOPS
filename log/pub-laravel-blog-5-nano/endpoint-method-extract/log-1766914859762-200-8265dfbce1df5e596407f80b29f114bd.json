        "content": "Here is the analysis based on the provided files.\n\nWhat are the full HTTP request paths for the Admin Media routes (prefix included)?\n- GET /admin/media\n- GET /admin/media/create\n- POST /admin/media\n- GET /admin/media/{media}\n- DELETE /admin/media/{media}\n\nNotes:\n- The routes come from Route::resource('media', MediaLibraryController::class)->only(['index', 'show', 'create', 'store', 'destroy']); so the endpoints correspond to index, create, store, show, and destroy actions only.\n- The {media} segment is the path parameter used by the resource routes.\n\nWhich HTTP methods are acceptable for this endpoint set (as defined by the code)?\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n\nMethods explicitly defined by the routes (and thus acceptable):\n- GET: true (for index and show)\n- POST: true (for store)\n- DELETE: true (for destroy)\n\nOther standard REST methods not defined by this resource:\n- PUT: false\n- PATCH: false\n- HEAD: true (see explanation below)\n- OPTIONS: true (see explanation below)\n- TRACE: false\n\nExplanation and caveats:\n- The route definitions come from a Laravel resource route limited to index, show, create, store, and destroy, which yields the five endpoints listed above. Therefore, the accepted methods are GET (index/show), POST (store), and DELETE (destroy). PUT/PATCH/EDIT are not defined (no update), so those methods are not acceptable.\n- HEAD and OPTIONS are not explicitly defined in the code, but Laravel’s routing layer typically handles HEAD requests automatically for GET routes, and OPTIONS requests are generally handled by the framework as part of the route handling/HTTP spec behavior. Based on the code (using Laravel resource routes that include GET endpoints), HEAD and OPTIONS are effectively acceptable.\n- Potential runtime caveat in the code: In MediaLibraryController::show, the method signature is show(Media $medium), but the route parameter is {media}. Laravel’s implicit binding expects the parameter name in the controller method to match the route parameter name. Since the route uses {media} but the method uses $medium, the route-model binding for this action may not bind correctly, potentially causing a runtime error when accessing GET /admin/media/{media}. If this were fixed (e.g., show(Media $media) to match {media}), the endpoint would function as expected.\n\nSummary:\n- Paths (with admin prefix): see list above.\n- all methods: false\n- HEAD: true\n- POST: true\n- OPTIONS: true\n- TRACE: false\n- GET: true\n- PUT: false\n- DELETE: true\n- PATCH: false\n\nExplanation: The results follow from the explicit resource routes (index, show, create, store, destroy). HEAD/OPTIONS are typically handled by the framework for GET endpoints, but there is a potential binding issue in the show method due to the parameter name mismatch {media} vs $medium that could affect runtime behavior for that endpoint."
