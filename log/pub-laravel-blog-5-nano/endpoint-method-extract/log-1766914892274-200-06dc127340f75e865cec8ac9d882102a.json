        "content": "Full HTTP request path\n- /api/v1/users/{user}\n\nNotes:\n- The endpoint is registered via Route::apiResource('users', UserController::class)->only('update') inside the v1/api group, which maps to the update method for the user resource at the path /api/v1/users/{user}. The parameter {user} uses route-model binding to a User model.\n- This route is inside a middleware group requiring auth:sanctum and verified, so the operation requires authenticated and verified users.\n\nHTTP methods acceptance (based strictly on the code)\n\n- All methods acceptable? No\n  - The update endpoint is defined only for update, which uses PUT and PATCH. There is no registration for other methods on /api/v1/users/{user} in this route file.\n\n- HEAD: true\n  - There is a GET route for the same path (show) registered elsewhere in the API (outside the auth group). Laravel typically handles HEAD requests automatically for GET routes, so HEAD is effectively acceptable because a GET route exists for this path.\n\n- POST: false\n  - The update route does not define POST for /api/v1/users/{user} (only PUT/PATCH). POST is not registered for this endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS: true\n  - While not explicitly defined in routes, Laravel’s router/CORS middleware handling typically provides OPTIONS support for routes that exist. Since there are defined methods on this path (GET for show, PUT/PATCH for update), OPTIONS is effectively supported at runtime by the framework for this path.\n\n- TRACE: false\n  - There is no TRACE route defined for this endpoint, and TRACE is not registered by the resource router.\n\n- GET: true\n  - The GET method is defined for /api/v1/users/{user} via the public index/show routes (show is registered outside the auth-protected group). Therefore, GET is supported for this path.\n\n- PUT: true\n  - The update method for UserController is registered with PUT when using apiResource(...)->only('update').\n\n- DELETE: false\n  - The update-only resource does not register DELETE for /api/v1/users/{user}.\n\n- PATCH: true\n  - The update method also registers PATCH, so PATCH is supported for /api/v1/users/{user}.\n\nExplanation\n- The UserController@update method is part of a Laravel API resource route for users with only the update action inside a group protected by auth:sanctum and verified, resulting in the path /api/v1/users/{user} supporting PUT and PATCH under authentication.\n- There is a separate public registration for users with index and show, which is why GET is available for /api/v1/users/{user} even outside the auth group.\n- HEAD is considered acceptable because a corresponding GET route exists for the same path, and Laravel handles HEAD requests for GET routes.\n- OPTIONS is generally handled by the framework (and any CORS middleware) when routes exist; since there are defined methods for this path, OPTIONS is considered acceptable by the framework, though it is not explicitly defined in the routes file.\n- The endpoint does not support POST, DELETE for the update action, per the explicit registrations in routes/api.php. The authentication requirement is noted but not part of the method-acceptance evaluation beyond its effect on accessibility.\n\nSummary of method acceptances for /api/v1/users/{user}\n- HEAD: true\n- GET: true\n- PUT: true\n- PATCH: true\n- OPTIONS: true\n- POST: false\n- DELETE: false\n- TRACE: false\n- All methods: false"
