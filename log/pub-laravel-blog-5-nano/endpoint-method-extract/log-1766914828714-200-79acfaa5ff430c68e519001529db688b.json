I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostCommentController.php`, I found that `PostCommentController::class, 'index'` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

All other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this endpoint.\n- HEAD requests are generally handled by Laravel for routes that support GET, so HEAD is effectively acceptable for this endpoint, even though it is not explicitly defined in the code.",
