        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint mapped to CommentController@show.\n\n- Full HTTP request path: /api/v1/comments/{comment}\n  - Reason: routes/api.php defines a top-level resource route for comments (public) under the v1 prefix. The overall API routes are already under the /api prefix, so the final path is /api/v1/comments/{comment}. The {comment} part uses route model binding.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable: false\n  - Reason: The code defines only GET (show) for this endpoint in the public routes. There is no support for all methods on this path.\n\n- HEAD acceptable: true\n  - Reason: Laravel automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that respond to GET. The show method is mapped to GET, so HEAD is effectively supported by the framework for this route.\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no POST route for this path mapping to CommentController@show. A POST would be mapped to a different action or not defined.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS route defined for this path in the code. Without explicit handling or middleware, OPTIONS is not defined here.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Reason: Not defined anywhere in the routes; TRACE is not implemented in this endpoint according to the code.\n\n- GET acceptable: true\n  - Reason: The show method is defined and used for GET on this resource route, returning the CommentResource.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No PUT route is defined for this path mapping to show; PUT is not implemented for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - Reason: Although DELETE is defined for the same resource path in an authenticated group (destroy), the show endpoint itself is mapped to GET. For the show-specific mapping, DELETE is not handled by CommentController@show.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No PATCH route defined for this path to map to show; PATCH is not implemented for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The routes/api.php file defines API routes under /api prefix and further under /v1 due to Route::prefix('v1'). The public (unauthenticated) routes register index and show for comments, which map to GET /api/v1/comments and GET /api/v1/comments/{comment}. The show method specifically handles GET for a single comment; HEAD is implicitly supported by Laravel for GET. Other methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this particular show endpoint in the public route group. Note that there is also an authenticated group that defines DELETE for comments (destroy), but that is a separate route under the same path and would require authentication; it does not affect the show endpoint’s GET mapping."
