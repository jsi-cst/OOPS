        "content": "Analysis result\n\n- Full HTTP request path (with leading slash and path parameter in braces):\n  - /comments/{comment}\n\n  Rationale: The CommentController::destroy method is registered via Route::resource('comments', CommentController::class)->only(['store', 'destroy']); inside the authenticated/verified middleware group. The destroy route for a resource is DELETE /comments/{comment}.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint:\n  - No (false)\n\n  Rationale: The code defines only the DELETE route for this endpoint (destroy). The store route (POST /comments) is a separate route, but not applicable to this specific endpoint. No other methods are declared for /comments/{comment}.\n\n- HEAD acceptable:\n  - No (false)\n\n  Rationale: There is no explicit handling of HEAD for this endpoint, and Laravel does not automatically enable HEAD for non-GET routes based on code alone. The destroy route is defined for DELETE, not GET, so HEAD is not supported by the code.\n\n- POST acceptable:\n  - No (false)\n\n  Rationale: The DELETE route for /comments/{comment} is not a POST route. The POST /comments route exists separately for store, but that is not the same endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable:\n  - No (false)\n\n  Rationale: The code does not define an OPTIONS route for /comments/{comment}. Without an explicit route or framework-level handling shown in code, we cannot mark OPTIONS as acceptable based on the provided code.\n\n- TRACE acceptable:\n  - No (false)\n\n  Rationale: No TRACE route is defined in the code for /comments/{comment}.\n\n- GET acceptable:\n  - No (false)\n\n  Rationale: The destroy method responds to DELETE. There is no GET route for /comments/{comment} in the provided code.\n\n- PUT acceptable:\n  - No (false)\n\n  Rationale: The destroy route is DELETE, not PUT.\n\n- PATCH acceptable:\n  - No (false)\n\n  Rationale: The destroy route is DELETE, not PATCH.\n\nAdditional context/explanation\n\n- The destroy endpoint is protected by the auth and verified middleware, so requests must be authenticated and the user must be verified. This is determined by the routes/auth.php grouping, which places the resource route inside Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->group(...). So even though the path is /comments/{comment}, you must be an authenticated and verified user to invoke DELETE on this resource.\n\n- The existence of the store method (POST /comments) is a separate route from the destroy method (DELETE /comments/{comment}); they share the same base path but are distinct HTTP methods and thus distinct endpoints. For the specific endpoint in question (destroy), only DELETE is acceptable per the code."
