I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostLikeController.php`, I found that `App\\Http\\Controllers\\Api\\V1\\PostLikeController@store` is implemented to process HTTP requests. To determine the full path with the correct prefix and the acceptable HTTP methods, I found the necessary information in other files.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of all related files, and your task is to determine and output:\n\n- The full HTTP request path for the endpoint, which must begin with a forward slash (/) and have path parameters wrapped in curly braces ({}).\n- Whether all HTTP methods are acceptable, this will override the results for other HTTP methods.\n- Whether the HEAD method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the POST method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the OPTIONS method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the TRACE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the GET method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PUT method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the DELETE method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n- Whether the PATCH method is acceptable, based on the code, not on experiential assumptions.\n\nYou also need to provide an explanation of your results."

There is also a separate DELETE route for the same path, but that maps to a different controller method (destroy). Therefore not all methods are acceptable for this specific endpoint.\n\n- Is HEAD acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no HEAD route defined for this path, and HEAD would only be implicitly handled if a GET route existed. Since only POST is defined for this endpoint, HEAD is not acceptable based on the code.\n\n- Is POST acceptable for this endpoint?\n  Yes. The PostLikeController@store endpoint is registered as a POST route at /api/v1/posts/{post}/likes.\n\n- Is OPTIONS acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No explicit OPTIONS route is defined for this endpoint in the code. Therefore, OPTIONS is not considered acceptable based on the code provided.\n\n- Is TRACE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no TRACE route defined for this endpoint in the code.\n\n- Is GET acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no GET route defined for this endpoint; only POST is defined for the store method on this path.\n\n- Is PUT acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no PUT route defined for this endpoint.\n\n- Is DELETE acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No for the store endpoint. Although there is a DELETE route defined on the same path (/api/v1/posts/{post}/likes) mapped to PostLikeController@destroy, that route does not apply to the store method. Therefore, DELETE is not acceptable for this particular endpoint (store).\n\n- Is PATCH acceptable for this endpoint?\n  No. There is no PATCH route defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation\n\n- The route is defined inside the v1 API group and under the auth:sanctum, verified middleware, indicating authentication is required to access the endpoint.\n- The store action is registered via Route::post('/posts/{post}/likes', PostLikeController@store, ...), so the only supported HTTP method for the store endpoint is POST.\n- There is a separate DELETE route for the same path that targets PostLikeController@destroy, but that is a separate endpoint (same path, different method/view), not an extension of the POST endpoint. For the specific PostLikeController@store endpoint, only POST is valid.\n- No explicit GET/HEAD/OPTIONS/PUT/TRACE/PATCH routes are defined for this particular endpoint, so they are not considered acceptable based on the code.",
