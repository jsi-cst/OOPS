        "content": "Here are the HTTP endpoints that map to App\\Http\\Controllers\\UserController and the HTTP methods they accept, based on the routes files you provided.\n\n1) Path: /users/{user}\n   - Controller action: show (App\\Http\\Controllers\\UserController::show)\n   - Acceptable HTTP methods: GET\n   - Notes on HEAD: HEAD requests are automatically handled by Laravel for GET routes (the same response headers as GET, but with no body). Since this endpoint is defined as GET, HEAD is effectively supported by the framework for this route.\n\n2) Path: /settings/account\n   - Controller action: edit (App\\Http\\Controllers\\UserController::edit)\n   - Acceptable HTTP methods: GET\n   - Notes on HEAD: As with the previous route, HEAD is supported for GET routes by the framework.\n\n3) Path: /settings/account\n   - Controller action: update (App\\Http\\Controllers\\UserController::update)\n   - Acceptable HTTP methods: PUT, PATCH\n   - Notes on HEAD: HEAD is not typically defined for non-GET routes. This route is not a GET route, so HEAD requests are not a standard expectation here unless the framework explicitly maps HEAD to non-GET routes (which Laravel does not do by default).\n\nExplanation of results:\n- The UserController is used in two route groups:\n  - In routes/web.php, a resource route for users is limited to the show method, yielding GET /users/{user} for viewing a user.\n  - In routes/auth.php (under the auth/verified middleware group with the settings prefix), there are two routes for the same UserController:\n    - GET /settings/account to display the edit form (edit method).\n    - PUT/PATCH /settings/account to handle updates (update method).\n- Therefore, the full endpoints related to UserController are:\n  - GET /users/{user} -> show\n  - GET /settings/account -> edit\n  - PUT /PATCH /settings/account -> update\n- There are no other HTTP methods (POST, DELETE, etc.) defined for this controller in the provided files.\n- For HEAD:\n  - HEAD is effectively supported for the GET endpoints by Laravel’s default behavior, as HEAD requests on GET routes are handled by the framework.\n  - HEAD is not typically applicable to the non-GET (PUT/PATCH) endpoint, unless Laravel provides a non-default mapping, which it does not here.\n\nIf you want this expressed strictly in an OpenAPI-like summary, you’d document three paths with the methods listed above, and note that HEAD is implicitly supported for the GET endpoints by the framework."
