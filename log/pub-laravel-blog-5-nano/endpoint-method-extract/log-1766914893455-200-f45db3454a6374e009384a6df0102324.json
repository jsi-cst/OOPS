Laravel automatically handles HEAD requests for GET routes, so HEAD is effectively supported by the framework for this endpoint.\n\n- GET acceptable: true\n  - Reason: The show method is explicitly defined and exposed via Route::apiResource(...)->only(['index','show']).\n\n- POST acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No POST route is defined for this endpoint; only GET is enabled.\n\n- PUT acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No PUT route is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- PATCH acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No PATCH route is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- DELETE acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No DELETE route is defined for this endpoint.\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable: false\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS route defined for this endpoint in the code. Unless the framework (or CORS middleware) handles OPTIONS globally, the code does not indicate an OPTIONS handler for this path.\n\n- TRACE acceptable: false\n  - Reason: No TRACE route is defined for this endpoint.\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint in question is PostController@show, which is registered via Route::apiResource('posts', PostController::class)->only(['index','show']); This means only GET requests to /api/v1/posts/{post} (and GET /api/v1/posts for index) are supported. The path parameter {post} corresponds to Laravel’s route-model binding for a Post model.\n- The HEAD method is not explicitly defined in the routes, but Laravel treats HEAD requests as handled for any existing GET route, so HEAD is effectively acceptable.\n- Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this endpoint in the code, so they are not acceptable per the codebase."
