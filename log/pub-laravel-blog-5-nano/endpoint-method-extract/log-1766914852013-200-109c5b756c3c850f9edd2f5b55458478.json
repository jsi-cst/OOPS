        "content": "Here is the analysis based on the provided files.\n\nWhat are the HTTP endpoints (paths) and accepted methods for the Comment resource?\n\n- Root index (list comments)\n  - Path: /admin/comments\n  - Method: GET\n\n- Edit a specific comment (show edit form)\n  - Path: /admin/comments/{comment}/edit\n  - Method: GET\n\n- Update a specific comment\n  - Path: /admin/comments/{comment}\n  - Methods: PUT, PATCH\n\n- Delete a specific comment\n  - Path: /admin/comments/{comment}\n  - Method: DELETE\n\nNotes:\n- The routes are defined via Route::resource('comments', CommentController::class)->only(['index', 'edit', 'update', 'destroy']), which maps to:\n  - index -> GET /admin/comments\n  - edit -> GET /admin/comments/{comment}/edit\n  - update -> PUT/PATCH /admin/comments/{comment}\n  - destroy -> DELETE /admin/comments/{comment}\n- The /admin prefix and admin. route naming are inferred from the file location (routes/admin.php) and usage in redirects (admin.comments.edit). This means the actual paths include /admin/.\n\nAre all HTTP methods acceptable? No.\n- Only the methods above are acceptable. Other HTTP methods (e.g., POST) are not defined for this resource.\n\nHeadings for each requested item:\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable? False\n  - Reason: The resource is limited to index (GET), edit (GET), update (PUT/PATCH), and destroy (DELETE). POST, OPTIONS, TRACE, etc., are not defined by these routes.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? True (for GET routes)\n  - Reason: Laravel handles HEAD requests for GET routes automatically. Since index and edit are defined as GET routes, HEAD requests to /admin/comments and /admin/comments/{comment}/edit are handled by the framework.\n\n- POST acceptable? False\n  - Reason: POST is not defined by the resource (no store or create methods exposed).\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? False (based on the code)\n  - Reason: The code defines only GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE methods for the resource. OPTIONS is not explicitly defined. (Note: In practice, some frameworks handle OPTIONS automatically, but based strictly on the code, it’s not an allowed method here.)\n\n- TRACE acceptable? False\n  - Reason: Not defined by the resource.\n\n- GET acceptable? True\n  - Reason: index (GET /admin/comments) and edit (GET /admin/comments/{comment}/edit) are defined.\n\n- PUT acceptable? True\n  - Reason: update supports PUT /admin/comments/{comment}.\n\n- PATCH acceptable? True\n  - Reason: update supports PATCH /admin/comments/{comment}.\n\n- DELETE acceptable? True\n  - Reason: destroy supports DELETE /admin/comments/{comment}.\n\nExplanation:\n- The CommentController is registered via a resource route with only the methods index, edit, update, and destroy. This yields the four endpoint patterns above across the admin prefix. The GET routes (index and edit) are the ones that allow retrieving views; update supports both PUT and PATCH; destroy supports DELETE. The HEAD method is not explicitly defined in the code, but Laravel automatically handles HEAD for GET routes, so HEAD is acceptable for the GET endpoints. POST, OPTIONS, TRACE are not defined by the resource in the code, so they are not considered acceptable by the code given. The endpoints are inferred to live under the /admin/ prefix due to the admin routes context and route naming (e.g., admin.comments.edit)."
