        "content": "Here is the analysis focused on the PostController resource as defined in the given routes and controller file.\n\nWhat are the full request paths (with the correct API prefix) for PostController endpoints?\n- GET /api/v1/posts\n- GET /api/v1/posts/{post}\n- POST /api/v1/posts\n- PUT /api/v1/posts/{post}\n- PATCH /api/v1/posts/{post}\n- DELETE /api/v1/posts/{post}\n\nNotes on the paths:\n- All routes live under the API version prefix v1, as defined by Route::prefix('v1')->group(...) in routes/api.php. The API base path is therefore /api, and with the v1 prefix it becomes /api/v1/...\n- Path parameters use Laravel route model binding: {post}.\n\nWhich HTTP methods are acceptable for these endpoints, according to the code (not based on guesswork)?\n- GET: acceptable (index and show exist)\n- POST: acceptable (store exists)\n- PUT: acceptable (update exists; Laravel treats PUT and PATCH for updates)\n- PATCH: acceptable (update exists)\n- DELETE: acceptable (destroy exists)\n\nOther methods:\n- HEAD: acceptable in practice for GET routes due to standard HTTP behavior and Laravel’s handling of HEAD for GET routes. The code itself does not define a HEAD method, but Laravel automatically handles HEAD for GET routes.\n- OPTIONS: acceptable in practice. The code does not define an OPTIONS route, but Laravel typically responds to OPTIONS for existing routes (often via framework-level handling or CORS middleware). This is not explicit in the controller, but is commonly supported by the framework in this context.\n- TRACE: not defined or supported by these routes; there is no TRACE handling in the code, so TRACE would not be supported.\n\nIs “all HTTP methods are acceptable” true or false?\n- False. Only a specific set of methods are defined for the Post resource (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and the framework behavior (HEAD/OPTIONS) is not defined in the code but is generally handled by the framework. There is not a single endpoint that accepts every HTTP method.\n\nExplanation of results:\n- The endpoint paths come from the Laravel resource routing defined in routes/api.php for PostController. The v1 version prefix and the apiResource registrations determine the exact URIs:\n  - Public GET endpoints: index (GET /api/v1/posts) and show (GET /api/v1/posts/{post}).\n  - Protected endpoints (require authentication per middleware): store (POST /api/v1/posts), update (PUT/PATCH /api/v1/posts/{post}), and destroy (DELETE /api/v1/posts/{post}).\n- The HTTP method availability mirrors the standard Laravel resource controller actions implemented in PostController:\n  - index -> GET\n  - show -> GET\n  - store -> POST\n  - update -> PUT or PATCH (both are supported for updates)\n  - destroy -> DELETE\n- HEAD is not explicitly defined in PostController, but is generally handled by Laravel for GET routes, so HEAD is effectively acceptable for the GET endpoints and not for non-GET endpoints.\n- OPTIONS is not explicitly defined, but most frameworks respond to OPTIONS for defined routes (often used for CORS preflight). This is not explicit in the code but is a typical framework behavior.\n- TRACE has no support in the provided routes or controller; there is no TRACE handling in the code.\n\nIf you want these as a compact OpenAPI-ready summary, they correspond to the following endpoints with their typical allowed methods:\n- /api/v1/posts: GET, HEAD (implicitly), OPTIONS (implicitly), POST (requires auth)\n- /api/v1/posts/{post}: GET, HEAD (implicitly), OPTIONS (implicitly), PUT, PATCH, DELETE (the latter three require auth)\n\nLet me know if you want me to draft a formal OpenAPI spec excerpt for these Post endpoints including parameters, responses, and authentication requirements."
