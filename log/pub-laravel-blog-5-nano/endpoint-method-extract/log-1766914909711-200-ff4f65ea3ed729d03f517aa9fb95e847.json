        "content": "Here are the required results based on the provided routes and controller code.\n\n1) Full HTTP request path for the endpoint (for MediaController@index)\n- /api/v1/media\n\nExplanation:\n- All routes are defined under Route::prefix('v1')->name('api')->group(...)\n- The apiResource for media is defined outside the auth middleware with only 'index' (Route::apiResource('media', MediaController::class)->only('index');)\n- The default API prefix from Laravel is /api, and the version prefix is v1, yielding /api/v1/media for the index action.\n\n2) Are all HTTP methods acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No\n\nExplanation:\n- The index method is wired only to the GET action (Route::apiResource(...)->only('index')). No other HTTP methods are defined for this endpoint in the code.\n\n3) Is HEAD acceptable for this endpoint?\n- Yes\n\nExplanation:\n- In Laravel (and most frameworks), HEAD requests are automatically handled for GET routes. Since index is a GET route, HEAD is effectively supported even though not explicitly defined in the code.\n\n4) Is POST acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No\n\nExplanation:\n- The index action is mapped only to GET. POST is defined for creating media in a different route (store) but not for this index endpoint. Therefore, for the index endpoint /api/v1/media, POST is not acceptable.\n\n5) Is OPTIONS acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No (not explicitly defined)\n\nExplanation:\n- The code defines only the index route for this endpoint. There is no explicit OPTIONS route. While some frameworks may respond to OPTIONS automatically for CORS or for other reasons, based solely on the code provided, OPTIONS is not defined for this endpoint.\n\n6) Is TRACE acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No\n\nExplanation:\n- TRACE is not defined anywhere in the routes for this endpoint, and is not handled by the controller.\n\n7) Is GET acceptable for this endpoint?\n- Yes\n\nExplanation:\n- The index method is defined and implemented, and the route is restricted to 'index' for the media resource. This is the primary method for this endpoint.\n\n8) Is PUT acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No\n\nExplanation:\n- PUT is not defined for this endpoint in the code (only GET is defined via index).\n\n9) Is DELETE acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No\n\nExplanation:\n- DELETE is not defined for this endpoint in the code (only GET is defined via index).\n\n10) Is PATCH acceptable for this endpoint?\n- No\n\nExplanation:\n- PATCH is not defined for this endpoint in the code (only GET is defined via index).\n\nSummary explanation:\n- The endpoint for MediaController@index is /api/v1/media.\n- Only GET (and implicitly HEAD) are supported for this specific endpoint based on the code.\n- Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this index endpoint in the provided code. The POST method exists for creating media, but that is a separate route (store) under the same resource, and not the index endpoint."
