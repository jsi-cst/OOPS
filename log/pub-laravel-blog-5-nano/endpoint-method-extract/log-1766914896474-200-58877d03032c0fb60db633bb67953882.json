        "content": "Here is the analysis for the endpoint handled by App\\Http\\Controllers\\Api\\V1\\UserController@index.\n\n- Full HTTP request path (must start with / and include path parameters in {}): /api/v1/users\n  - Reason: The route is defined in routes/api.php inside the Route::prefix('v1') group, and API routes are prefixed with /api. The index action is registered via Route::apiResource('users', UserController::class)->only(['index', 'show']), which maps GET /api/v1/users to UserController@index.\n\n- All HTTP methods acceptable? false\n  - Reason: The index route is only defined for GET (and via Laravel behavior, HEAD is implicitly handled for GET, but not all methods are supported). Other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE) are not defined for this endpoint.\n\n- HEAD acceptable? true\n  - Reason: Laravel automatically handles HEAD requests for routes that respond to GET. Since GET /api/v1/users is defined, HEAD is effectively acceptable by framework behavior.\n\n- POST acceptable? false\n  - Reason: No POST route defined for /api/v1/users (only GET for index and GET for show are defined in public API routes).\n\n- OPTIONS acceptable? false\n  - Reason: There is no explicit OPTIONS route defined for this endpoint, and the code does not provide an OPTIONS route.\n\n- TRACE acceptable? false\n  - Reason: No TRACE route defined, and the code does not provide TRACE handling.\n\n- GET acceptable? true\n  - Reason: The index method is explicitly registered via the public API resource route: Route::apiResource('users', UserController::class)->only(['index', 'show']).\n\n- PUT acceptable? false\n  - Reason: No PUT route defined for /api/v1/users (the only methods defined for this resource are index and show in public routes).\n\n- DELETE acceptable? false\n  - Reason: No DELETE route defined for /api/v1/users (index and show only; update is defined only in the auth group for different actions, not for index).\n\n- PATCH acceptable? false\n  - Reason: No PATCH route defined for /api/v1/users (only index and show are defined publicly).\n\nExplanation:\n- The endpoint for listing users is exposed via a public API route defined as Route::apiResource('users', UserController::class)->only(['index', 'show']); inside the v1 API group. This maps GET /api/v1/users to UserController@index and GET /api/v1/users/{user} to UserController@show. The index method returns a paginated collection of users with related counts/roles.\n- HEAD is not explicitly defined but Laravel automatically handles HEAD requests for GET routes, so HEAD is effectively acceptable.\n- No other HTTP methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE) are defined for this endpoint in the provided routes, so they are not acceptable. The only strictly defined method for this endpoint is GET (and implicitly HEAD)."
