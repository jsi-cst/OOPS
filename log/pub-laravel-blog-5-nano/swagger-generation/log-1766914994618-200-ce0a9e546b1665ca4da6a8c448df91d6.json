I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/posts/{post}` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php`, `PostController::class` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}` with HTTP method GET.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostController.php`, `PostController::class, 'show'` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n- The provided PostController implements a show method for the route /posts/{post} with HTTP GET. It returns a Laravel view (HTML response) for a specific Post, after augmenting the Post model with comments_count and likes_count.\n- Since the action renders a Blade view (return view('posts.show', ['post' => $post])), the HTTP response type is HTML content.\n- In Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 terms, the operation would produce text/html, and the successful response (200) would carry HTML content. However, the task asks only for the dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses), so we should describe the 200 response with a payload that represents an HTML body.\n- The most appropriate minimal representation for an HTML response in the Swagger 2.0 Response Object is a 200 response with description and a schema of type string (the HTML content). We should avoid introducing additional status codes or complex schemas since the given information does not specify other behaviors or error handling.\n- Therefore, the response object should reflect a 200 OK with a description like \"Successful operation\" and a schema of type string to indicate HTML text content.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"200\": {\n    \"description\": \"Successful operation\",\n    \"schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n}",
