I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/admin/media` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/MediaLibraryController.php`, `MediaLibraryController::class` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/admin/media` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "First, here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n- The endpoint is DELETE /admin/media and is handled by MediaLibraryController::destroy, which receives a Media model instance via route-model binding, deletes it, and returns a RedirectResponse to the admin.media.index route with a success flash message.\n- Therefore, on successful deletion, the HTTP response is a redirect (HTTP status 302 Found) to the index page of the admin media section (likely /admin/media).\n- If the specified Media resource cannot be found (e.g., invalid identifier or it was already deleted), Laravel would return a 404 Not Found due to route-model binding behavior.\n- The controller method does not return any body content for the redirect; it relies on the Location header to indicate where to go next. In OpenAPI/Swagger 2.0 terms, this should be represented as a 302 response with a Location header. A 404 response may be included to reflect the not-found case. No request bodies or response schemas are strictly needed for a simple redirect, though headers can be described.\n- Based on the above, the Response Objects dictionary for paths[\"/admin/media\"][\"delete\"].responses should include:\n  - 302: description of redirect, and a Location header of type string indicating where to redirect (e.g., /admin/media).\n  - 404: description indicating the resource was not found.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"302\": {\n    \"description\": \"Found. The resource was deleted and the client is redirected to the admin.media.index page.\",\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"Location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"URL to redirect to (admin/media)\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"404\": {\n    \"description\": \"Not Found. The specified media resource could not be found.\"\n  }\n}",
