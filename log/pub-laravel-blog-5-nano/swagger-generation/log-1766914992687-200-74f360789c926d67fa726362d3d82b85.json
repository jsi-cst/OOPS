I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/admin/posts/{post}/thumbnail` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/PostThumbnailController.php`, `[PostThumbnailController::class, 'destroy']` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/admin/posts/{post}/thumbnail` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

This is an HTTP redirect (status 302 Found) and typically includes a Location header pointing to the edit page URL for that post.\n- Therefore, the OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger 2.0) Response Object for this endpoint should describe a 302 response with a Location header indicating the URL to redirect to. There is no response body in a typical redirect.\n- I will provide a single response object for the 302 status code, including the Location header as a string. No other response codes or schemas are included since the implementation clearly indicates a redirect behavior for a normal successful path.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"302\": {\n    \"description\": \"Redirect to the admin post edit page\",\n    \"headers\": {\n      \"Location\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"description\": \"URL to redirect to\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}",
