I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/comments/{comment}` with method DELETE, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/CommentController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\CommentController@destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/comments/{comment}` with HTTP method DELETE.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "Here's my reasoning:\n\n- The destroy method in CommentController handles HTTP DELETE requests to /comments/{comment}. It first runs authorization with $this->authorize('delete', $comment);, which means that if the authenticated user is not allowed to delete the comment, a 403 Forbidden response will be produced. If the comment does not exist (route model binding could fail), Laravel would typically return a 404 Not Found. If the request is made without authentication, a 401 Unauthorized could be returned by the auth middleware (though not explicit in the method, it is a common pathway). On success, the method deletes the comment and returns a Turbo Stream response containing multiple actions: removing the comment element and updating the comments count.\n\n- The actual HTTP response body is a Turbo Stream payload, not a standard JSON body. In Swagger/OpenAPI 2.0 terms, we document possible HTTP response codes and descriptions. We do not have a JSON schema for the body since the content is Turbo Stream HTML, so we provide descriptive response entries without a schema.\n\n- Therefore, in the Swagger 2.0 \"responses\" object for the path /comments/{comment} with method DELETE, we can represent:\n  - 200: Successful deletion with a Turbo Stream payload that removes the comment and updates the count.\n  - 401: Unauthorized (authentication required).\n  - 403: Forbidden (not authorized to delete this comment).\n  - 404: Not Found (comment does not exist).\n\nNow the final generated result begins\n{\n  \"200\": {\n    \"description\": \"Turbo Stream response containing actions to remove the deleted comment and update the comments count.\"\n  },\n  \"401\": {\n    \"description\": \"Unauthorized. Authentication is required to delete a comment.\"\n  },\n  \"403\": {\n    \"description\": \"Forbidden. The authenticated user does not have permission to delete this comment.\"\n  },\n  \"404\": {\n    \"description\": \"Not Found. The specified comment does not exist.\"\n  }\n}",
