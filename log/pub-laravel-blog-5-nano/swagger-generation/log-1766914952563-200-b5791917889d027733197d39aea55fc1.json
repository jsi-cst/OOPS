I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/posts/{post}/comments` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/PostCommentController.php`, `PostCommentController::class, 'index'` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/posts/{post}/comments` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a list of Parameter Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].parameters) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the list of Parameter Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "Here is the step-by-step reasoning I used to derive the OpenAPI parameter object for the GET /posts/{post}/comments endpoint:\n\n- The endpoint is /posts/{post}/comments with the GET method. The controller method that handles it is PostCommentController::index(Post $post), indicating Laravel route model binding for the {post} parameter.\n- Because the method signature uses a type-hinted Post model, the {post} segment in the path is a path parameter that identifies a Post. Therefore, the parameter object must represent this path parameter.\n- There are no query parameters or request body parameters involved in this method, as it simply fetches the post’s comments and returns a view.\n- For the parameter type, {post} typically corresponds to the Post model’s primary key (commonly an integer ID) in Laravel applications. Therefore the type is most likely integer.\n- The parameter is required since the path includes {post}, and the route would not match without it.\n\nBased on this, the Parameter Object for Swagger 2.0 is:\n\nthe final generated result begins\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"post\",\n    \"in\": \"path\",\n    \"required\": true,\n    \"type\": \"integer\"\n  }\n]",
