I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/admin/media` with method POST, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/MediaLibraryController.php`, `MediaLibraryController::class` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/admin/media` with HTTP method POST.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n- The POST /admin/media endpoint is implemented by MediaLibraryController@store.\n- The store method accepts a MediaLibraryRequest (a FormRequest), gets an uploaded file from the 'image' field, and optionally uses a provided 'name'. It then stores the image into the first MediaLibrary's media collection via Spatie Media Library, and finally redirects to the admin.media.index route with a success flash message.\n- Therefore, the endpoint results in an HTTP redirect (RedirectResponse) after handling the request.\n- In case of validation failures within MediaLibraryRequest, Laravel would typically redirect back to the form with validation errors, which is also a redirect. So the primary response type for this endpoint is a 302 Found redirect.\n- There is no explicit API response body defined in the code; the response is a redirect, which generally has no body. The OpenAPI 2.0 response object for this endpoint should reflect the 302 redirect behavior.\n- Based on the code, the only defined response status for this endpoint is 302. We can describe this response as redirecting to the media index page on success (and also redirecting back to the form on validation failure). The response does not include a schema.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"302\": {\n    \"description\": \"Redirect to the media index page on successful creation of the media. Validation failures also result in a redirect back to the form with errors.\"\n  }\n}",
