I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/settings/password` with method GET, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/UserPasswordController.php`, `App\\\\Http\\\\Controllers\\\\UserPasswordController@edit` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/settings/password` with HTTP method GET.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

The description can reflect that this is the HTML content of the password edit form.\n- Therefore, the Response Object for status 200 should indicate a successful HTML response with a string schema. We will not invent additional responses (like redirects or errors) since the provided code does not specify them in the response body and we are to include only the Response Objects.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"200\": {\n    \"description\": \"OK\",\n    \"schema\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n}",
