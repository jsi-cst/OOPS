I need to generate an OpenAPI Specification for a web project based on its backend source code. I'm now focusing on endpoint `/api/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with method POST, and here is the relevant information I found:\n\n1. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\Http\\Controllers\\Api\\V1\\PostLikeController@store` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/api/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method POST.\n\n2. In `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/PostLikeController.php`, `App\\Http\\Controllers\\Api\\V1\\PostLikeController@destroy` is implemented to process HTTP requests to `/api/v1/posts/{post}/likes` with HTTP method POST.\n\nI'll provide you with the contents of the files mentioned above, you have the option to execute additional Unix commands to gather more information if necessary, but you must not run the source code of the project, and your task is to generate a dict of Response Objects (the value of paths.[endpoint].[method].responses) in Swagger 2.0 format.\n\nYou need to think step by step and provide an explanation of your results first. Then, output exactly \"the final generated result begins\" (I will split your output and then do json parse, so you must output it and do not change it), followed by the dict of Response Objects in JSON format. Do not include fields not mentioned above, and do not use references ($ref) in your output (try to obtain the structure by executing additional Unix commands)."

          "content": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n- The provided file defines a Laravel API controller PostLikeController with two methods: store and destroy, both intended to handle requests to /api/v1/posts/{post}/likes.\n- The store method returns $post->like(), and the destroy method returns $post->dislike(). This indicates that a successful operation will produce a non-structured response determined by the Post model methods, but there is no explicit HTTP status code or payload schema in the code snippet.\n- Since the prompt requires generating a Swagger 2.0 (OpenAPI 2.0) Response Objects dictionary for the endpoint and method POST, and we are not to introduce additional fields beyond what is implied, the minimal valid response object for a successful operation is a 200 response with a description.\n- To comply with the instruction to avoid using $ref and to keep the output strictly to the Response Objects, we provide only the 200 response entry with a short description: \"OK\". This keeps the representation simple and aligns with the information given (a successful operation returning the result of like() or dislike()) without speculating on the exact payload structure.\n\nthe final generated result begins\n{\n  \"200\": {\n    \"description\": \"OK\"\n  }\n}",
