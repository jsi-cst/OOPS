Based on the `ls` output, here's my analysis:\n\n*   **pom.xml:** This file is a strong indicator that the project is built using **Java** and the **Maven** build tool. Maven is commonly used for Java projects.\n*   **src:** This directory typically contains the source code of the project.\n*   **Procfile:** This file is used by Heroku to specify the commands that are executed to start the application. This is often used in web applications.\n\nBased on this information, I'm confident that the primary programming language is **Java**, and the primary development framework is likely a Java web framework such as **Spring Boot** or **Jakarta EE**. To confirm this, I would like to examine the contents of the `pom.xml` file. I will use the `run_command` tool to read the file.\n\n",
