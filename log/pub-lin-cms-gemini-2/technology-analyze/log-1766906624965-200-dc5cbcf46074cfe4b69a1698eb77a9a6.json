Based on the file names provided, I can see the following:\n\n*   `pyproject.toml`: This file suggests the project uses Python, as it's a common file for Python projects, often used with tools like Poetry or similar.\n*   `requirements.txt`: This file also indicates the project uses Python, as it's used to list Python package dependencies.\n*   `starter.py`: This is likely a Python script, which further confirms Python as the primary language.\n*   `gunicorn.conf.py`: This file suggests the use of Gunicorn, a Python WSGI HTTP server.\n*   `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `docker-deploy.sh`: These files indicate the project uses Docker for containerization and deployment.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of the framework, I'll use the `default_api.run_command` to check the contents of `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` to see if any specific web frameworks are listed as dependencies.\n\nBased on the output of `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`, the project uses the Flask web framework.\n\nTherefore, the primary programming language is Python, and the primary development framework is Flask.\n"
